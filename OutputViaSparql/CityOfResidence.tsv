Borrowing $25,000 from his wife's parents, Broad put up half the capital in their first venture together, building two model homes in the Northeast Detroit suburbs where the new generation of home buyers were flocking. Broad was responsible for land acquisition and materials while Kaufman handled the design. By streamlining the construction process, they could price the houses so the monthly mortgage would be less than the rent for a two-bedroom apartment. The Kaufman & Broad model featured an attached carport and omitted the basement. They christened this model the "Award Winner" and priced it at $13,700. After one weekend, seventeen were sold and within two years, Kaufman & Broad had built 600 homes in the Detroit suburbs. In 1960, fearing that the Detroit economy was too dependent on the automotive business, they moved to Phoenix, Arizona. In 1961, Kaufman and Broad Home Corporation (now KB Home) went public on the American Stock Exchange.

They "made and promoted graffiti; all had tagging names. All moved easily between representation and abstraction, the street and the studio, and worked in various media including painting, sculpture, drawing, collage, and installation. Although each developed a distinct artistic style and philosophy, they all were drawn to the radical and the political. Not surprisingly, all took inspiration from Bay Area Figuration, the Beats, Funk art, and Punk." Boas immersed herself in the work of the artists who would come to be known as members of the Mission School in 2002. She contributed the essay "A Partial and Incomplete Oral History of the Mission School" to the catalog for the Barry McGee exhibit at the Berkeley Art Museum; her essay was also included in the book associated with the show.

He continued to vehemently deny any wrongdoing but volunteered to donate a total of $4.4 million to settle the case as long as he selected the recipient organizations in advance. Anschutz paid $100,000 to each of 32 New York nonprofit philanthropic groups that he selected, as well as $200,000 to each of six law schools he also pre-selected. In return, Spitzer dropped his civil suit. The payment was roughly equal to his profit from the practice of IPO "spinning", thus he actually suffered no penalty. The controversial suit by Spitzer was panned in a Wall Street Journal editorial headlined, "The Anschutz Ransom". The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice extensively investigated Qwest officials, and determined that there was no justification for taking action against any board member.

The following week, Jericho explained his actions by dismissing the WWE roster as imitations of himself and singling out Punk for calling himself the best in the world, a moniker Jericho used the last time he was in WWE. Their rivalry continued through Elimination Chamber where Punk retained the WWE Championship in the namesake structure; while four competitors were eliminated, Jericho was unable to continue the match after being kicked out of the chamber by Punk, causing temporary injury. The following night on Raw, Jericho earned a match against Punk at WrestleMania XXVIII, and in a bid to psychologically unsettle him, he revealed Punk's father was an alcoholic and alleged that his sister was a drug addict, asserting that Punk's straight edge philosophy was paranoia to avoid the same vices and vowing to make Punk turn to alcohol by winning the title from him. John Laurinaitis added the stipulation that the WWE Championship could change hands via disqualification, which led to Jericho inciting Punk into using a weapon, but Punk resisted and retained the title. On the April 2 and 9 episodes of Raw SuperShow, Punk retained the WWE Championship against Mark Henry after losing to him via count-out and disqualification. Following both matches, Jericho attacked Punk and doused him with alcohol. On the April 16 Raw SuperShow, Punk pinned Henry in a no disqualification, no countout match to retain his title.
