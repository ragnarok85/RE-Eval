He managed the cartel's public relations and justified kidnappings and killings by stating that they were done to protect law-abiding citizens. On July 2009, he allegedly coordinated an attack that killed 12 Mexican federal police officers in Michoacán two days following the arrest of Arnoldo Rueda, one of La Familia Michoacana's leaders. In early 2010, La Familia Michaocana leaders formed an alliance with the Gulf Cartel and Sinaloa Cartel in opposition to Los Zetas, which had separated from their former allies, the Gulf Cartel. Los Zetas, on the other hand, joined forces with the Juárez Cartel, Tijuana Cartel, and the Beltrán Leyva Cartel. On December 2010, La Familia Michoacana's spiritual leader Moreno González was killed in a two-day shootout with the Mexican federal police in Michoacán. With his death, Loya Plancarte was placed as a top security priority by the Mexican government. The death of the leader led to an internal power struggle within La Familia Michoacana; Gómez Martínez, Planarte Solís, and Loya Plantarte left the criminal organization and formed the Knights Templar Cartel	http://nif.dbpedia.org/wiki/en/Dionisio_Loya_Plancarte?dbpv=2016-10&nif=phrase&char=3831,3853

704	Christian Keysers	Employer	Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience	Section	1	Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience	He finished his school education at the European School, Munich and studied psychology and biology at the University of Konstanz, the Ruhr University Bochum, University of Massachusetts Boston, the Shepens eye research Institute of the Harvard Medical School as well as with Marvin Minsky at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He then started his research career at the University of St Andrews by investigating cells in the Temporal cortex with David Perrett, and described cells that respond when the monkey views particular faces in a way that correlates with conscious perception. After that, he moved to the University of Parma where he was part of the team that discovered auditory mirror neurons in the frontal cortex of the macaque monkey. He then expanded the notion of mirror neurons to emotions and sensations, by showing that your somatosensory cortex is active not only when you are being touched, but also if you see someone else being touched, and that your insular cortex is active not only if you feel disgusted, but also if you see someone else being disgusted. More recently, he has looked at the neural basis of abnormal empathy in schizophrenia, autism and psychopathy. Currently, Keysers is a full Professor for the Social Brain at the Brain and Cognition program of the University of Amsterdam and he co-leads the Social Brain Lab of the prestigious Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience	http://nif.dbpedia.org/wiki/en/Christian_Keysers?dbpv=2016-10&nif=phrase&char=1456,1494
704	Christian Keysers	Employer	Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience	Section	5	Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience	After finishing his Master, Christian Keysers decided to concentrate on a subfield of cognitive neuroscience called social neuroscience that uses neuroscience methods to understand how we process the social world. He therefore performed his doctoral studies at the University of St Andrews with David Ian Perrett, one of the founding father of the field, to understand how the brain processes faces and facial expressions. This thesis work lead to new insights into how quickly the brain can process the faces of others. During this period, Christian became fascinated with the question of how the brain can attach meaning to the faces of others. How is it for instance, that we understand that a certain grimace would signal that another person is happy? How do we understand that a certain bodily movement towards a glass indicates that the other person aims to grasp a glass? In 1999, Christian was exposed to a visit of Vittorio Gallese, who presented his recent discovery of mirror neurons in the Psychology department lecture series. This deeply influenced Christian who decided to move to the lab of Giacomo Rizzolatti to undertake further studies on how these fascinating neurons could contribute to social perception.In 2000, after finishing his doctorate, Christian Keysers moved to the University of Parma to study mirror neurons. In early work there demonstrated that mirror neurons in the premotor cortex not only respond to the sight of actions, but also when actions can only be deduced or heard, leading to a publication in the journal science. This work had tremendous impact on the field, as it suggested that the premotor cortex could play a central, modality independent role in perception and may lay the origin for the evolution of speech in humans. Together this work indicated that brain regions involved in our own actions play a role in how we process the actions of others. Christian wondered whether a similar principle may underlie how we process the tactile sensations and emotions of others, and became increasingly independent of the research focus on the motor system in Parma. At the time, Christian had also met his to be wife, Valeria Gazzola, a biologist in the final phases of her studies, and together they decided to explore if the somatosensory system might be involved in perceiving the sensations of others. Via a fruitful collaboration with the French Neuroimaging specialist Bruno Wicker, they used Functional magnetic resonance imaging, and showed for the first time, that the Secondary somatosensory cortex, previously thought only to represent a persons own experiences of touch, is also activated when seeing someone or something else be touched. They also showed that the insula, thought only to respond to the experience of first hand emotions, was also activated when we see another individual experience similar emotions. Together this indicated a much more general principle than the original mirror neuron theory, in which people process the actions, sensations and emotions of others by vicariously activating owns own actions, sensations and emotions. Jointly, this work laid the foundation of the neuroscientific investigation of empathy.Based on this influential work, that was warded the Marie Curie Excellence Award, Christian and Valeria were offered to open their own laboratory at the University of Groningen, where Christian became an assistant professor in 2004, an associate professor in 2005 and a full professor for the neural basis of empathy in 2007, when he was only 34 years old, as one of the youngest full professors of the University. Together with his wife, his work in Groningen concentrated on using human neuroimaging techniques to understand the role of motor, somatosensory and limbic structures in understanding the inner states of others and the dysfunctions of these systems in psychiatric patients. While in Groningen, the team also demonstrated that rats show empathy for the others In 2010, they were then offered to move to the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience	http://nif.dbpedia.org/wiki/en/Christian_Keysers?dbpv=2016-10&nif=phrase&char=8964,9002

Naturally, the league officials hated it." In addition to making theatrical events of routine outs, he was considered an "individualist" who played fast and loose with the league's rules of conduct. For example, rather than working from behind second base as mandated by the American League, he would frequently stand between the pitcher and the base, National League-style. He would routinely converse with players during between-inning breaks and even during play, a practice strictly forbidden by the league. In 1973 during spring training, he switched positions with Buddy Bell, playing a portion of an inning at third base while Bell umpired. (Both were reprimanded by the league.) For all his antics, his skills were respected by the players: In a 1974 Major League Baseball Players Association	http://nif.dbpedia.org/wiki/en/Ron_Luciano?dbpv=2016-10&nif=phrase&char=2594,2635

1542	Otto Kahn-Freund	Employer	London School of Economics	Section	2	London School of Economics	He became judge of the Berlin labour court, 1929. Kahn-Freund wrote a pathbreaking article, contending that the Reichsarbeitsgericht (Empire Labour Court) was pursuing a "fascist" doctrine in 1931. According to Kahn-Freund, fascism shared liberalism’s dislike of state intervention and preference for private ownership, social conservatism’s embrace of welfare provision for insiders, and collectivism’s view that associations are key actors in class conflict. In the case law Kahn-Freund presented, the Reichsarbeitsgericht had been systematically undermining collective rights in work councils, demanding that trade unionists owed a duty to the Betrieb (the workplace) which was indistinguishable from the employer. On the other hand, the court had demanded that individual workplace rights (for instance, to social insurance) were strongly protected. The article was shunned by the German Legal Academy and the trade unions at the time, but in retrospect has been seen as tragically accurate. Kahn-Freund continued working as a judge until 1933, shortly after Hitler seized the Chancellorship in coalition with the conservative DNVP. He found that radio workers were falsely accused of being communist and were entitled to maximum damages for unfair dismissal. He was then dismissed by the Nazis in 1933. He fled to London and became a student at the London School of Economics	http://nif.dbpedia.org/wiki/en/Otto_Kahn-Freund?dbpv=2016-10&nif=phrase&char=1694,1720

He was recognized as "Canada's leading legal scholar on extradition law" by Larry Rousseau, executive vice president of the Public Service Alliance of Canada. His U.S.-published Extradition between Canada and the United States, cited by the Supreme Court of Canada, criticized Canada's level of cooperation with the United States in international criminal matters, arguing that Canada's policy of placing international comity over individual rights had dangerously expanded executive discretion and damaged human rights protections. The book received favourable reviews in the Law & Politics Book Review and the Revue québécoise de droit international. Another of his works on extradition law, Canadian Extradition Law Practice, which has gone through five editions, contains broader criticisms of Canada's network of extradition treaties, in particular of the erosion of the double criminality requirement. His Extradition: Individual Rights vs. International Obligations, published in Stuttgart, Germany, was released in 2010, and Halbury's Laws of Canada: Extradition and Mutual Legal Assistance the following year. His Wrongful Conviction in Canadian Law (2010) examines Canadian commissions of inquiry into miscarriage of justice. The book's foreword was written by David Milgaard, who was convicted of a murder he did not commit and spent 23 years in prison. Botting spent four years as a visiting scholar and post-doctoral fellow at University of Washington School of Law	http://nif.dbpedia.org/wiki/en/Gary_Botting?dbpv=2016-10&nif=phrase&char=23675,23713

1704	Michael R. Licona	Employer	Houston Baptist University	Section	2.3	Houston Baptist University	In a passage in his 2010 book, The Resurrection of Jesus: A New Historiographical Approach, Licona questioned the interpretation of the story of the resurrection of the saints in Matthew 27, and suggested the possibility that it might be apocalyptic imagery. This led to controversy with fellow Evangelical scholars Norman Geisler and Albert Mohler, who both accused Licona of denying the full inerrancy of the Bible in general and the gospel narratives in particular. Licona maintained that adjusting an interpretation on a text is not a denial of inerrancy. In the course of events, Licona resigned in 2011 from his position as research professor at Southern Evangelical Seminary and as apologetics coordinator for the North American Mission Board (NAMB). Other Evangelical scholars such as William Lane Craig, J.P. Moreland, and Gary Habermas voiced their support for Licona by signing an open letter to Geisler. In a round table discussion on the issue, Craig Blomberg urged that another educational institute of similar prestige offer him a teaching role.

2747	M. G. Smith	Employer	University of the West Indies	Section	1	University of the West Indies	Born in Kingston, Jamaica, M.G. Smith was always a brilliant scholar. As a schoolboy at Jamaica College, one of the island's leading secondary schools, his schoolmates claimed him as their "intellectual hero." In 1939 at age seventeen, Smith achieved the highest marks of all Higher Schools Certificate candidates in the entire British Empire. More than a student scholar, he later emerged as a published poet of very considerable promise. His scholarly feats earned him the prestigious Jamaica Scholarship, which did not bring him to Bombay as he had wished, but to Canada, where he went to study English Literature at McGill University. Joining the Canadian army during the war, he served briefly on the frontline in Europe, in France, Holland and Germany. Demobilized in London in 1945, he turned from literature to law, which he studied for a year before the fateful switch to anthropology. As his wife Mary reported, Smith found the law "an ass" and not, as he had hoped, about justice. He took to anthropology quickly and anthropology to him. Soon he became a prize student in Daryll Forde's department at University College London, completed his undergraduate work in short order, and after very successful field research in Northern Nigeria, was awarded the Ph.D. in 1951. He subsequently carried out extensive field research in Northern Nigeria, Jamaica, Grenada, and Carriacou.

2868	M. G. Smith	Employer	University of California, Los Angeles	Section	1	University of California, Los Angeles	Born in Kingston, Jamaica, M.G. Smith was always a brilliant scholar. As a schoolboy at Jamaica College, one of the island's leading secondary schools, his schoolmates claimed him as their "intellectual hero." In 1939 at age seventeen, Smith achieved the highest marks of all Higher Schools Certificate candidates in the entire British Empire. More than a student scholar, he later emerged as a published poet of very considerable promise. His scholarly feats earned him the prestigious Jamaica Scholarship, which did not bring him to Bombay as he had wished, but to Canada, where he went to study English Literature at McGill University. Joining the Canadian army during the war, he served briefly on the frontline in Europe, in France, Holland and Germany. Demobilized in London in 1945, he turned from literature to law, which he studied for a year before the fateful switch to anthropology. As his wife Mary reported, Smith found the law "an ass" and not, as he had hoped, about justice. He took to anthropology quickly and anthropology to him. Soon he became a prize student in Daryll Forde's department at University College London, completed his undergraduate work in short order, and after very successful field research in Northern Nigeria, was awarded the Ph.D. in 1951. He subsequently carried out extensive field research in Northern Nigeria, Jamaica, Grenada, and Carriacou. Smith served as the Senior Research Fellow, Institute of Social and Economic Research University of the West Indies (Jamaica); Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles	http://nif.dbpedia.org/wiki/en/M._G._Smith?dbpv=2016-10&nif=phrase&char=1690,1727

2965	M. G. Smith	Employer	Yale University	Section	1	Yale University	Born in Kingston, Jamaica, M.G. Smith was always a brilliant scholar. As a schoolboy at Jamaica College, one of the island's leading secondary schools, his schoolmates claimed him as their "intellectual hero." In 1939 at age seventeen, Smith achieved the highest marks of all Higher Schools Certificate candidates in the entire British Empire. More than a student scholar, he later emerged as a published poet of very considerable promise. His scholarly feats earned him the prestigious Jamaica Scholarship, which did not bring him to Bombay as he had wished, but to Canada, where he went to study English Literature at McGill University. Joining the Canadian army during the war, he served briefly on the frontline in Europe, in France, Holland and Germany. Demobilized in London in 1945, he turned from literature to law, which he studied for a year before the fateful switch to anthropology. As his wife Mary reported, Smith found the law "an ass" and not, as he had hoped, about justice. He took to anthropology quickly and anthropology to him. Soon he became a prize student in Daryll Forde's department at University College London, completed his undergraduate work in short order, and after very successful field research in Northern Nigeria, was awarded the Ph.D. in 1951. He subsequently carried out extensive field research in Northern Nigeria, Jamaica, Grenada, and Carriacou. Smith served as the Senior Research Fellow, Institute of Social and Economic Research University of the West Indies (Jamaica); Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles; Senior Research Fellow, Research Institute for the Study of Man, New York City; Franklin M.

3676	Ernst Nolte	Employer	Free University of Berlin	Section	1	Free University of Berlin	In 1941, Nolte was excused from military service because of a deformed hand, and he studied Philosophy, Philology and Greek at the Universities of Münster, Berlin, and Freiburg. At Freiburg, Nolte was a student of Martin Heidegger, whom he acknowledges as a major influence. From 1944 onwards, Nolte was a close friend of the Heidegger family, and when in 1945 the professor feared arrest by the French, Nolte provided him with food and clothing for an attempted escape. Eugen Fink was another professor who influenced Nolte. After 1945 when Nolte received his BA in philosophy at Freiburg, he worked as a Gymnasium (high school) teacher. In 1952, he received a PhD in philosophy at Freiburg for his thesis Selbstentfremdung und Dialektik im deutschen Idealismus und bei Marx (Self Alienation and the Dialectic in German Idealism and Marx).

4113	Tatsumi Kimishima	Employer	Nintendo	Section	2.2.4	Nintendo Co., LTD.	After the release of the GameCube in 2001, President of Nintendo since 1949, Hiroshi Yamauchi felt that it was the right time to step down from his position. His son-in-law, Minoru Arakawa, took over the role as President of Nintendo in America but retired only one year later in 2002. Nintendo, after the release of the GameCube, found themselves in third place to Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox in relation to sales. Some would even consider the introduction of this new gaming platform as a failure, especially when compared to Nintendo's dominance in the late 80's and early 90's. Yamauchi appointed Tatsumi Kimishima to become President of Nintendo of America in 2002. He was previously working as the head of Nintendo's Pokémon division. Four years after Kimishima's promotion he was promoted again, but this time to the position of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. Kimishima still watches over the management of Nintendo of America to ensure continued success of the company.

She recorded her last radiation treatment for others to view and understand the process."Having a positive attitude will get you through the treatment... You need to go to work, you need to get up, you need to go for walks, ...clean your house, pet your cat ...go to the movies." Her advice for persons in treatment is to stay as active as possible. "It was quite an adventure, and not something I would gladly do again for the heck of it, it wasn't as bad as I was led to believe." Gerbic says that she has felt guilty through this public process trying to find the right balance with her attitude. She did not want to send the message to others going through treatment, "who were having bad days, that there was something wrong with them, that they weren't thinking positively enough." She was uncomfortable with people telling her that she was a hero, when all she was doing was to keep a positive attitude. "The heroes are the scientists... the people behind the scenes... its science that did it for me."
