Through the cult Alexander achieved a certain level of political influence – his daughter married a governor of the Roman province of Asia. He found believers from Pontus to Rome through pretended arts of soothsaying and magic and was revered and consulted as a prophet by many notable individuals of his age. During the plague of 166 a verse from the oracle was used as an amulet and was inscribed over the doors of houses as a protection and an oracle was sent, at Marcus Aurelius' request, by Alexander to the Roman army on the Danube during the war with the Marcomanni, declaring that victory would follow on the throwing of two lions alive into the river. The result was a great disaster and Alexander had recourse to the old quibble of the Delphic oracle	http://nif.dbpedia.org/wiki/en/Alexander_of_Abonoteichus?dbpv=2016-10&nif=phrase&char=3713,3727

The Peter Hall-directed production was staged at the Old Vic, London and later transferred to the Music Box on Broadway. Ben Brantley, chief theatre critic for The New York Times, was particularly vocal in his praise. He noted that "Mr. Sheen elicits a real poetry from the role" and felt that, while watching him, "you start to appreciate the derivation of the term star. This actor is so luminous it's scary!" The Independent found him "quite stunning as Mozart. His fantastically physical performance convinces you of his character's genius and the play catches fire whenever he's on stage." Sheen was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Supporting Performance and an Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actor. In 1999, Sheen explored the role of Jimmy Porter in the National Theatre's production of Look Back in Anger. In 2003, Sheen described the production as "the most enjoyable thing I've ever done ... everything came together". The Daily Mail declared him a "definitive Jimmy Porter... simply exhilarating in his great jazz riffs of speeches, mercurial and irresistible." "Sheen has cornered the market in explosive energy", said The Independent, "but this thrilling performance is his finest yet." The Financial Times noted: "As Jimmy Porter, a role of staggering difficulty in every way, Michael Sheen gives surely the best performance London has yet seen from him ... You hang on every word he utters ... This is a dazzlingly through-the-body performance."

3633	Michael Sheen	Occupation	Actor	Section	2.4	Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Miniseries or Movie	partial	In 2010, Sheen had a supporting role in the science fiction sequel Tron: Legacy. Referring to his David Bowie-esque character, Sheen has said, "I was paid to show off basically". The Wall Street Journal found little fun in the movie "except for a gleefully campy turn by Michael Sheen" while The New York Times said he "shows up to deliver the closest thing to a performance in the movie". The Daily Telegraph felt his "lively hamming as a cane-swishing nightclub owner merely underlines how impersonal—how inhuman—much else here is". However, USA Today felt his "scenery-chewing performance ... is meant as comic relief, but this movie thunders along so seriously that the attempt at humor feels jarring". In other 2010 film work, Sheen provided the voices for characters in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland and Disney's Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue and appeared as a terrorist in Unthinkable. On television, Sheen's performance in the third instalment of Peter Morgan's Blair trilogy, The Special Relationship, was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Miniseries or Movie	http://nif.dbpedia.org/wiki/en/Michael_Sheen?dbpv=2016-10&nif=phrase&char=22353,22412

Filmed while he was playing Caligula nightly on stage, Sheen has remarked, "It’s interesting that in searching for monsters to play, you often end up playing leaders." The Daily Telegraph praised his "earnest, yet steely, portrayal" while The Guardian found him "excellent. This is intelligent and honest casting." In 2004, Sheen starred in ITV's Dirty Filthy Love, a comic film about a man dealing with OCD and Tourette's after a marital separation.

The film focused on the differing reactions of the British Royal Family and the newly appointed Prime Minister following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997; it was Sheen's third collaboration with director Stephen Frears and his second with screenwriter Peter Morgan. He enjoyed reprising his role because Blair, at this point in his career, had "a weight to him that he didn’t have before". When asked to discuss his personal opinion of Blair, Sheen admitted that the more time he spent working on the character, the "less opinion" he has of the politician: "Now when I watch him on TV or hear his voice, it's sort of like a cross between a family member, a friend and seeing a really old embarrassing video of yourself." Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised "a sensational performance, alert and nuanced" while Empire spoke of an "uncanny, insightful performance".

"I remember him saying to me, 'College is for people who don't know what they want to do,'" his brother said. Because there already was a Joseph Lane registered with Actors Equity, he changed his name to Nathan after the character Nathan Detroit from the musical Guys and Dolls.

3794	Carroll Baker	Occupation	Film	Section	2.2	Venice International Film Festival	partial	Baker went on to make the experimental film Something Wild (1961), directed by her then-husband Jack Garfein. In the gritty independent drama, she plays a young college student from the Bronx who is raped one night in St. James Park, and later held captive by a Manhattan mechanic (Ralph Meeker) who witnessed her subsequent suicide attempt. In preparation for her role, Baker lived alone in a boarding house in New York's Lower East Side, and got a job as a department store salesgirl; her method approach to the role was profiled in LIFE magazine in 1960. Critical reaction to the film was largely negative, though Film Quarterly cited it as "the most interesting American film of its quarter," and the most underrated film of 1961. However, its controversial depiction of rape led to critical backlash and public criticism, and the film has been oft-credited as almost halting Baker's career. The same year, she portrayed Gwen Harold in Bridge to the Sun, a 1961 production by MGM based on the 1957 best-selling autobiography of a Tennessee-born woman who married a Japanese diplomat (portrayed by James Shigeta) and became one of the few Americans to live in Japan during World War II.

He is an absolute gentleman on set and he is wonderful to everyone — from the actors to the entire crew, he treats everyone with respect." Lee Smith has been Nolan's editor since Batman Begins, with Dody Dorn editing Memento and Insomnia.

During a road trip from Chicago to Los Angeles, his brother Jonathan pitched the idea for "Memento Mori", about a man with anterograde amnesia who uses notes and tattoos to hunt for his wife's murderer. Nolan developed a screenplay that told the story in reverse; Aaron Ryder, an executive for Newmarket Films, said it was "perhaps the most innovative script I had ever seen". The film was optioned and given a budget of $4.5 million. Memento, starring Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss, premiered in September 2000 at the Venice International Film Festival to critical acclaim. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote in his review, "I can't remember when a movie has seemed so clever, strangely affecting and slyly funny at the very same time." Basil Smith, in the book The Philosophy of Neo-Noir, draws a comparison with John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding which argues that conscious memories constitute our identities, a theme which Nolan explores in the film.

Nevertheless, like its preceding entries, the film was a commercial success, grossing $362 million worldwide, and remains one of Cooper's highest-grossing releases.

Cooper was initially skeptical about playing the part which he thought was out of his depth, but he later accepted the role inspired by Russell's confidence in him.

To prepare, Cooper took dance training with the choreographer Mandy Moore, who describes Cooper as having "some real natural dancing ability." The film was a box-office success, earning $236.4 million on a production budget of $21 million. Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers said that Cooper "seizes the juiciest role of his career and meets every comic and dramatic challenge.

4275	Diane Keaton	Occupation	Actress	Section	2.1	Academy Award for Best Actress	partial	In 1977, Keaton starred with Allen in the romantic comedy Annie Hall, one of her most famous roles. Annie Hall was written and directed by Allen and the film was believed to be autobiographical of his relationship with Keaton. Allen based the character of Annie Hall loosely on Keaton ("Annie" is a nickname of hers, and "Hall" is her original surname). Many of Keaton's mannerisms and her self-deprecating sense of humor were added into the role by Allen. (Director Nancy Meyers has claimed "Diane's the most self-deprecating person alive.") Keaton has also said that Allen wrote the character as an "idealized version" of herself. The two starred as a frequently on-again, off-again couple living in New York City. Her acting was later summed up by CNN as "awkward, self-deprecating, speaking in endearing little whirlwinds of semi-logic", and by Allen as a "nervous breakdown in slow motion." The film was both a major financial and critical success, and won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Keaton's performance also won the Academy Award for Best Actress	http://nif.dbpedia.org/wiki/en/Diane_Keaton?dbpv=2016-10&nif=phrase&char=7215,7245

5842	Rani Mukerji	Occupation	Actress	Section	2.3	IIFA Best Actress Award	partial	Mukerji turned down an offer from Mira Nair to star in the Hollywood film The Namesake, choosing instead to collaborate once again with her friend Karan Johar in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), an urban drama dealing with infidelity and dysfunctional relationships. The high-profile production featured an ensemble cast of Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Preity Zinta and Kirron Kher, and told the story of two unhappily married couples in New York which results in an extra-marital affair. Mukerji played Maya Talwar, a woman layered with self-doubt and question about the relationship between her husband (played by Abhishek Bachchan) and herself. Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna was a popular release, emerging as a major economic success with gross earnings of over ₹1.13 billion (US$17 million). Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN wrote, "Rani looks a million bucks and she dives under the skin of her character to make that part one that we will remember for a long time".

The role was originally written for Twinkle Khanna, but when she rejected it, Johar approached several leading actresses, all of whom refused the offer. He eventually cast Mukerji after she volunteered to play the role. Johar had originally intended that a dubbing artist dub Mukerji's lines in the film, but she improved her diction and eventually dubbed for her own lines. She portrayed Tina Malhotra, a college student who is in a relationship with Khan's character. Writing for India Today, film critic Nandita Chowdhury considered Mukerji to be the scene-stealer and added, "Oozing oomph from every pore, she [..] proves herself an actress whose time has come." Kuch Kuch Hota Hai proved a breakthrough for Mukerji; it emerged as a blockbuster in India and abroad with earnings of over ₹1.03 billion (US$15 million), and won eight Filmfare Awards, including a Best Supporting Actress	http://nif.dbpedia.org/wiki/en/Rani_Mukerji?dbpv=2016-10&nif=phrase&char=6536,6559

5888	Samantha Morton	Occupation	Actress	Section	2.2	Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture	partial	Impressed by her performance in Under the Skin, Woody Allen cast her in Sweet and Lowdown (1999), a movie that opened to extremely positive reactions from film critics and writers and was a modest profit at the box office in its limited release. In the film, she gave an acclaimed performance and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2000. Critic Stephanie Zacharek wrote in her review "Rising star Samantha Morton shines in this charming, finely crafted film from Woody Allen" and that "Her performance is like nothing I’ve seen in recent years." Also, James Berardinelli said that Morton "overmatches her more experienced co-star with a luminous and heartbreaking performance" and George Perry for BBC.com called her "extraordinary" and remarked that she "has no need to fake an American accent. She plays an adoring mute who suffers. Denied speech, she uses her eyes to convey meaning, reviving techniques of silent cinema". In a 2007 interview with UK's The Guardian, she commented that her Oscar nomination for her part in Sweet and Lowdown "did incredible things for me in the States. I'm grateful for that.

5888	Samantha Morton	Occupation	Actress	Section	2.3	Best Actress	partial	Her last film in 2007 was another biopic feature, Elizabeth: The Golden Age (playing Mary, Queen of Scots), which came out in December that year. The movie gained mediocre reviews and, unlike the first  Elizabeth, the follow-up was not a success at the box office. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman cast Morton as Hazel in Synecdoche, New York, alongside Philip Seymour Hoffman, Michelle Williams and Emily Watson. The film was a box office bomb, but it was praised by critics, appearing on many top ten lists for 2008. In an interview with Movieline, Morton spoke about her experience of working with Kaufman, saying: "It was like going to school, every time. You were constantly learning a different way of working, a different way of looking at my craft. And also I was giving as much as I can. It was very liberating to work with him." Morton along with her co-stars were eventually nominated for the "Best Emsemble Performance" award at the 18th Gotham Independent Film Awards. The same year, she starred in the Irish indie horror The Daisy Chain, a movie about a couple who after the death of their daughter, take in an orphaned girl, only to become involved in a series of strange occurrences.

She received generally favorable notes for her part as she "quietly makes this quirky, enigmatic mood piece a compelling watch." In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Nick LaSalle stated that Morton "has moments of striking subtlety and detail. Her take upon receiving a major offer for her boyfriend's novel (which she claims as her own) is as satisfying a close-up as anyone could hope to see." And while Peter Travers wrote for Rolling Stone that she "fill this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling", Globe and Mail's Rick Groen stated that Samantha "still manages to suggest the internal struggle, and to slowly reveal a fierce toughness that flies in the face of conventional morality".

The film opened to mixed responses from critics. New York magazine noted that Morton "is one of those tingly actresses whose skin barely covers her soul, and to watch her search for tender mercies in a crazy-hostile world is a gift." Other critics were impressed by Morton and co-star Jason Patric's performances. She played Marilyn Monroe in the drama-comedy feature film Mister Lonely, which was first screened in 2007 at the Cannes Film Festival and later released in selected theaters to modest earnings. During an interview with newspaper The Guardian, she expressed that in the movie "we all live in a commune as the characters we impersonate and support each other. I'm married to a Charlie Chaplin impersonator and we have a daughter who is a Shirley Temple impersonator." Morton appeared in 2007's biographical film Control, again directed by Anton Corbijn. She played Deborah Curtis, wife of musician Ian Curtis from the band Joy Division, whose biography Touching from a Distance formed the basis of the film. After its premiere, the motion-picture along with the cast's performance generated positive feedback from film experts. While Roger Ebert wrote in his website that she was "absolutely convincing as a plucky teenage bride", Andrea Gronvall of Chicago Reader found Morton "poignant". Variety magazine called her performance "astonishing" and "sympathetic". Washington Post, Dark Horizons, Boston Globe and Philadelphia Inquirer also expressed praise for Morton's part in their reviews for the movie. For Control, she was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role	http://nif.dbpedia.org/wiki/en/Samantha_Morton?dbpv=2016-10&nif=phrase&char=13793,13842

Expressing her desire for "a new kind of acting challenge", Zinta described Mehta as one director she was longing to work with in order to fulfill it. To prepare for the part, she read and watched several books and documentaries on domestic violence. As the film was to be shot entirely in Punjabi, a language that was totally alien to her, she learnt it in a crash course of fifty days. She was emotional during the making of the film: "I never knew a character would affect me so deeply. I've become completely withdrawn and introspective... I can't snap out of the character." She eventually called it her most challenging project, as it helped her "shed everything that Preity Zinta was about." Heaven on Earth was first screened at several film festivals and, upon release, garnered career-best reviews for Zinta.

After finishing his studies of architecture at the Catholic University of Valparaiso, Jullian left his country for Europe, with the declared desire to work with Le Corbusier. Together with his wife, he visited the Swiss architect's works throughout Europe, before settling in Paris in 1958. There, he wrote a letter to Le Corbusier where he told him about Valparaíso and he declared his admiration for his work, asking him for work at his atelier. After a short exchange of letters, Jullian started working at the rue de Sèvres atelier in 1959, where he would stay until his master's death in 1965. After Le Corbusier fired all his previous collaborators, Jullian was his only employee for six months, until others started to arrive there. As chef de bureau at the atelier, Jullian collaborated in such landmark projects as Harvard University’s Carpenter Center, the Knowledge Museum at Chandigargh, the Olivetti Laboratories, the Baghdad Stadium, the French embassy in Brasilia, and the Venice Hospital. The latter project played an important role in the Team 10 discourse and is one of the clearest examples of mat-building typology and of the structuralist thinking in architecture	http://nif.dbpedia.org/wiki/en/Guillermo_Jullian_de_la_Fuente?dbpv=2016-10&nif=word&char=1294,1306

Men such as Raymond Loewy, Walter Dorwin Teague, and Norman Bel Geddes began heading their own firms. Belle Kogan became the only woman of the time to do the same. Throughout her career she had a wide range of notable clients including Reed and Barton, Red Wing Pottery, Bausch and Lomb, Boonton Molding, Libbey Glass, and Dow Chemical. She spoke on television and radio, gave lectures and interviews, wrote and exhibited her work frequently. In the late 1930s, she was one of the founding members of the New York chapter of the American Designers Insititute (ADI), which later evolved into the Industrial Designers Institute (IDI). She received the Personal Recognition Award in 1994 from the Industrial Designers Society of America	http://nif.dbpedia.org/wiki/en/Belle_Kogan?dbpv=2016-10&nif=phrase&char=7934,7973
