He is most famous for his works Ketzos ha-Shulchan, Piskei HaSiddur, Shi'urei Mikveh, and Shi'urei Torah, (Measurements of the Torah), in which he converted biblical measurements into contemporary measurements. The work is of significance as much of Jewish law involves specific requirements of certain sizes and quantities. Naeh was born in Hebron. His father, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Naeh, was the dean of the Magen Avos Yeshiva, founded by the Sdei Chemed. He studied in his youth at the Ohel Moshe Yeshiva, under Rabbi Yitzchak Yerucham Diskin. In 1912, Naeh published Chanoch LaNa'ar, a book containing laws for bar mitzvah boys. When World War I broke out, the Ottoman authorities expelled people from Palestine who did not possess Turkish citizenship. Many of the dispossessed Jews found refuge in Alexandria, Egypt, where Naeh opened a yeshiva called "Yeshivat Eretz Yisrael". His yeshivah had 200 students who had been exiled from Jerusalem. In Alexandria, Naeh wrote Shenot Chaim, a special Kitzur Shulchan Aruch for Sephardic Jews. In 1918, he returned to Palestine and served as the personal secretary of the Edah HaChareidis, under Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld,. He published his most famous work Ketzos HaShulchan in 1926. In 1948, he founded the Vaad HaRabbanim of Agudas Yisrael and later helped found the haredi weekly newspapers, Kol Yisrael and HaModia.

Aviem Sella (originally Slibiosiky), was born in Haifa during the Mandate era. He studied at the Hebrew Reali School, and began his national service in the Israel Defense Forces in 1963, joining the Israeli Air Force as a fighter pilot. In 1967, he fought in the Six-Day War with 109 Squadron. He was one of the first Israeli pilots to fly F-4 Phantom jets, and was also one of the founders of 69 Squadron. He fought in the War of Attrition of 1967-1970, participating in Operation Priha (January-April 1970) and Operation Rimon 20 (July 1970). The outbreak of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 found Sella in the United States studying at a professional course; he returned to Israel and fought in the war as deputy commander of 69 Squadron. Between 1976 and 1979 he commanded 201 Squadron, and between 1980 and 1983, he served as the Air Force's Director of Operations. He commanded Operation Opera, the air strike against the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981, and was a commanding officer in Operation Mole Cricket 19 during the 1982 Lebanon War. In the 1980s, Sella took a sabbatical to the United States to study, and earned an MA in computer science at New York University's Faculty of Computer Applications and Information Systems. While pursuing a PhD, Sella recruited Jonathan Pollard to spy for Israel. The US indicted Pollard on espionage charges in 1987. Pollard's Israeli handlers were granted immunity from prosecution in the United States in exchange for cooperation after Pollard's arrest. Sella's role, however, was unknown at the time and the Israelis were not forthcoming about his involvement. For this reason, Sella was not given immunity by the US when his role was uncovered. Israel then refused to extradite Sella for questioning. In March 1987 a Federal grand jury indicted Sella in absentia on three counts of espionage, with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a $500,000 fine. After Sella was promoted to Brigadier General and given command of Tel Nof Airbase, the U.S. Congress reacted by threatening to cut aid to Israel. U.S. officials in Israel were instructed to have no contact with Sella or with the airbase so long as he commanded it. Israel refused to relieve him of his duties, creating tensions. Sella then resigned to defuse US-Israel tensions, and was subsequently appointed an instructor at Israel's National Security College. Sella completed his PhD at Tel Aviv University's Faculty of Management and earned a degree in economics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1990 he founded "Sibm", an IT company, which acted as a consultant on information systems. In September 2003, he sold his company - which had 40 employees - to Matrix ID Ltd and became director of strategic consulting at Matrix's Security Division. From 2005 to 2006, he served as chairman of the Adam Milo Institute in Jerusalem. He also became a business partner of Alexander Beer, a brewery based in the Emek Hefer Industrial Park.

He was the son of Hormizd IV (reigned 579–590) and the grandson of Khosrow I (reigned 531–579). He was the last king of Persia to have a lengthy reign before the Muslim conquest of Iran, which began five years after his death by execution. He lost his throne, then recovered it with Roman help, and, a decade later, went on to emulate the feats of the Achaemenids, conquering the rich Roman provinces of the Middle East; much of his reign was spent in wars with the Byzantine Empire and struggling against usurpers such as Bahram Chobin and Vistahm. During the climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, Khosrow expanded deep into western Asia Minor, eventually besieging the Byzantine capital of Constantinople in 626 alongside Avar and Slavic allies. Following the failure of the siege, Heraclius started a counterattack, undoing all territorial gains by Khosrow in the Levant, most of Anatolia, the western Caucasus, and Egypt, eventually marching into the Sassanian capital of Ctesiphon. The Byzantines also regained the True Cross, which Khosrow had captured following his conquest of the Levant during the same 602–628 war. In works of Persian literature such as the Shahnameh and Khosrow and Shirin, a famous tragic romance by Nizami Ganjavi (1141–1209), a highly elaborated fictional version of Khosrow's life made him one of the greatest heroes of the culture, as much as a lover as a king. Khosrow and Shirin tells the story of his love for the Aramean or Roman princess Shirin, who becomes his queen after a lengthy courtship strewn with mishaps and difficulties.

Severus was born in Leptis Magna in the Roman province of Africa. As a young man he advanced through the cursus honorum—the customary succession of offices—under the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. Severus seized power after the death of Emperor Pertinax in 193 during the Year of the Five Emperors. After deposing and killing the incumbent emperor Didius Julianus, Severus fought his rival claimants, the generals Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus. Niger was defeated in 194 at the Battle of Issus in Cilicia. Later that year Severus waged a short punitive campaign beyond the eastern frontier, annexing the Kingdom of Osroene as a new province. Severus defeated Albinus three years later at the Battle of Lugdunum in Gaul. After consolidating his rule over the western provinces, Severus waged another brief, more successful war in the east against the Parthian Empire, sacking their capital Ctesiphon in 197 and expanding the eastern frontier to the Tigris. Furthermore, he enlarged and fortified the Limes Arabicus in Arabia Petraea. In 202, he campaigned in Africa and Mauretania against the Garamantes; capturing their capital Garama and expanding the Limes Tripolitanus along the southern frontier of the empire. Late in his reign he travelled to Britain, strengthening Hadrian's Wall and reoccupying the Antonine Wall. In 208 he invaded Caledonia (modern Scotland), but his ambitions were cut short when he fell fatally ill in late 210. Severus died in early 211 at Eboracum (today York, England), succeeded by his sons Caracalla and Geta. With the succession of his sons, Severus founded the Severan dynasty, the last dynasty of the empire before the Crisis of the Third Century.

He inaugurated his telegraph with a poem dedicated to the Swedish King on his birthday in 1794. The message went from the Palace in Stockholm to the King at Drottningholm. He eventually developed his own system which was quite different from its French counterpart and almost twice as fast. His system was based on ten collapsible iron shutters. The several positions of the shutters formed combinations of numbers which were translated into letters, words or phrases via codebooks. The telegraph network was made up of telegraph stations positioned at about 10 kilometres from one another. In 1796 he wrote A Treatise on Telegraphs. In 1797, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

He was the lead singer for Leevi and the Leavings since the forming of the band. The name "Leevi" is often taken to mean Sundqvist personally, although this is incorrect, and "Leevi" refers to a late friend of the band members. Sundqvist kept himself almost completely hidden from publicity and Leevi and the Leavings never performed in front of a live audience, with only one exception under the name "Tarmo Dynamo". In the 1980s and 90s, Gösta and the band gave some interviews but after the year 1996 Sundqvist became a total media hermit. Sundqvist is best remembered by the songs he composed, arranged, and wrote the lyrics for. His lyrics were down-to-earth which was probably the key to success among the Finnish public. His subjects covered loneliness, sexuality, alcoholism, metal health, environment and society, often with sarcasm and black humour. In 1990 Sundqvist expanded his work to include radio comedy. He wrote several humorous shows for the radio station formerly known as Radiomafia, including Tietokoneenkorjauskurssi ("Computer repair course") and Koe-eläinpuisto ("Test animal park"). Leevi and the Leavings started its career in end of 1970s, but it became popular in wider circles in second half of 1980s. The first hits included Pohjois-Karjala, Teuvo, maanteiden kuningas, Sopivasti lihava, Amalia and Rin Tin Tin. Sundqvist also wrote songs for "singer" Aarne Tenkanen, a pseudonym of Kai Järvinen. Tenkanen was originally one of the characters appearing in radio shows of Sundqvist. Gösta Sundqvist died abruptly from a heart attack at his home in Espoo on August 16, 2003, being only 46 years old. His father also had a short lived life. Only hours before his death, he was in a studio recording a new version of a Leavings song meant to appear on their next single.

The regency was contested by his first cousin, Hugh of Brienne, who was the son of Mary of Cyprus, the eldest daughter of Hugh I and hence the senior heir to Cyprus, and heir to Jerusalem after Hugh II. However, the Haute Cour of Jerusalem declared Hugh of Antioch the next regent, as successor to Isabella in proximity of blood. Hugh II died in 1267 without heirs.

He is considered to have been a major influence on the Red Hot Chili Peppers' early sound. Born in Haifa, Israel	Hillel Slovak (Hebrew: הלל סלובק‎‎; April 13, 1962 – June 25, 1988) was an Israel-born American musician best known as the original guitarist and founding member of the Los Angeles rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. Prior to his death of a heroin overdose in 1988, Slovak recorded two albums with the band, Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). His guitar work was primarily rooted in funk and hard rock, although he often experimented with other genres including reggae and speed metal. He is considered to have been a major influence on the Red Hot Chili Peppers' early sound. Born in Haifa, Israel, Slovak immigrated with his family to the United States in 1967 when he was five years old. Slovak met future band mates Anthony Kiedis, Flea, and Jack Irons while attending high school in Los Angeles. He joined the group Anthym along with Irons while attending Fairfax High School; Flea would later join the group, which later changed its name to What Is This?. Slovak, Flea, Kiedis, and Irons started Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1982, which became popular in the Los Angeles area, playing various shows around the city. However, Slovak quit the band to focus on What is This?, which had gotten a record deal, leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers to record their debut album without him. He rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1985, and recorded the albums Freaky Styley and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan with the band. During his career, Slovak developed a serious heroin addiction. He attempted to quit the drug many times, but ultimately succumbed to his addiction, dying of an overdose on June 25, 1988 at age 26. He was replaced by guitarist John Frusciante, who was greatly influenced by Slovak's playing style. Several Red Hot Chili Peppers songs have been written as tributes to Slovak, including "Otherside", "Knock Me Down", "My Lovely Man", and Feasting on the Flowers. In 1999, his brother James Slovak published a book entitled Behind the Sun: The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak, which features Slovak's diaries and paintings. Slovak was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on April 14, 2012, with his brother accepting on his behalf.

Xanthus also wrote occasionally about geology. It is believed that Xanthus was the earliest historian to have written a significant amount on the topic of Lydian history. He is also believed to have written a work entitled Magica (Mαγικά), as well as one entitled Life of Empedocles. It is believed that Xanthus had some knowledge of Persian traditions, and it is plausible that he, a Lydian, would write about Persian religion, but it seems unlikely due to the available evidence. His seat was believed to be at Sardis, the capital. A contemporary and colleague of Herodotus, most of his writings concerned the lineage and deeds of the Lydian kings. Xanthus was known for writing in the traditional Ionian style of trying to establish the scene of popular myths. One example of Xanthus using this type of writing style is when he placed the scene of the "giant's punishment" in Katakekaumene. Xanthus was also known for adapting historical events that were often considered boring into passages that the general Greek public would enjoy. Xanthus was one of the chief authorities used by Nicolaus of Damascus.

Plautianus was originally from Leptis Magna, southeast of Carthage (modern Libya, North Africa). He was a maternal cousin and long-time friend of Roman Emperor Lucius Septimius Severus. Plautianus' father was another Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, born ca 130, whose sister, Fulvia Pia (ca 125 - aft. 198), was married to Severus' father Publius Septimius Geta. Plautianus was appointed Prefect Commander of the Praetorian Guard in 197. Due to their friendship, Severus rewarded Plautianus with various honors, including a consular insignia, a seat in the Roman Senate and the Consulship of 203. During his consulship, Plautianus' image was minted on coins along with Severus' second son Publius Septimius Geta. He assisted Severus in administering the empire and became very wealthy and powerful. Severus made him his second in command. In 202, Plautianus married his daughter Publia Fulvia Plautilla to Caracalla (Severus’ first son) in Rome. Plautianus became so powerful that Roman Empress Julia Domna and Caracalla began to be concerned. The marriage between Caracalla and Publia Fulvia Plautilla was not a happy one. In fact, Caracalla loathed both her and her father, threatening to kill them after becoming sole emperor. When Plautianus discovered this, he plotted to overthrow Severus' family. When Plautianus' treachery was discovered, the imperial family summoned him to the palace and ordered his death on 22 January 205. After his death, Plautianus’ property was confiscated, his son of the same name, daughter and granddaughter were exiled to Sicily and then later to Lipari and his name was erased from public monuments. His son, daughter and granddaughter were strangled on Caracalla's orders in early 212.

He described the singing which he heard in the churches of the Carpathian regions: "In Subcarpathian Rus’ in all the villages both among the Uniates and also among the Orthodox, there was always practiced only congregational singing of the complete services.... The numerous chants ... were known by everyone, even the children of school age. The leader of song—the most experienced singer from the parish—standing at the kliros and sang the chant. As soon as the worshippers heard the beginning, they would join in the chant and the entire church sang; they sang all the stikhery, all the troparia, all the irmosy—in a word, everyone sang properly." Johann von Gardner died at 26th February 1984 in Munich.

Olympias was born and raised either in Constantinople or Antioch. She was the daughter born to the Antiochian Greek noblewoman, Alexandra and the wealthy Greek Rhetor, Seleucus. Olympias had a sibling, who was a parent of Olympias and Seleucus. Olympias was the namesake of her late paternal aunt Olympias who was once engaged to the Roman emperor Constans who later married the Roman Client King of Arsacid Armenia Arsaces II (Arshak II). The paternal grandfather of Olympias was Flavius Ablabius who had held consular rank in Constantinople, while her maternal uncle was Calliopius the Rhetor who served as a grammaticus and assistant-teacher under the Rhetor, historian Libanius and later served as a Roman official under the Roman emperors Constantius II and Julian the Apostate. Olympias is described as the ‘beloved daughter’ born to Seleucus and Alexandra. In her adult years, Olympias would later go to marry a nobleman called Nebridius who served as Prefect of Constantinople. After her husband died and refusing many offers of marriage, she dedicated her life to the church, serving (possibly in an ordained capacity) as a deaconess. She would later become a friend of Saint John Chrysostom. Her good works included building a hospital, an orphanage and even looking after Monks who had been led in exile from Nitria. All of this even led to John Chrysostom telling her that she had done almost too much. Her support for John Chrysostom led her to being exiled in 404, which resulted her in losing her house and living the rest of her life in exile at Nicomedia, where she would die on July 25, 408, after a long illness. Olympias is one of the 140 Colonnade saints which adorn Saint Peter's Square.

Saint Serapia was born at Antioch in the late 1st century, of Christian parents who, fleeing the persecution of Emperor Hadrian, went to Italy and settled there. When her parents died, Serapia was sought in marriage by many, but having resolved to consecrate herself to God alone, she sold all her possessions and distributed the proceeds to the poor. Then she sold herself into voluntary slavery, and entered the service of a Roman noblewoman named Sabina. The piety of Serapia, her love of work, and her charity soon gained the heart of her mistress, who became a Christian. She died in 119 CE. In the reign of Hadrian, Serapia was commanded to do homage to the gods of Rome. She refused and was handed over to two men who tried to rape her, but she resisted. They then tried to set her on fire with torches, but could not do so. By command of the judge Derillus, she was beaten with rods and then beheaded by sword. Her body was buried by Sabina in Sabina's own tomb, near the Vindician field, but the memory of her martyrdom is kept more especially on September 3, on which day their common tomb was finished, adorned and consecrated as a fitting place of prayer. In art, Saint Serapia holds a tablet or book; sometimes she appears with Saint Sabina.

After getting married and having a baby, Wiggins began a comeback, placing 14th at the Olympic Test Event in London. Returning to Australia, she partnered with Rachel Bugg and, after very limited preparation, defeated Melissa Wu and Alexandra Croak at the Australian Nomination Trials.

Piccinini was born in Bologna into a musical family: his father Leonardo Maria Piccinini taught lute playing to Alessandro as well as his brothers Girolamo (d. 1615) and Filippo (d. 1648). He held appointments at the Este court in Ferrara (from 1582 to 1597) and with Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini, papal legate at Bologna and Ferrara. Piccinini died around 1638, probably in Bologna. He is best known for his two volumes of lute music: Intavolatura di Liuto et di Chitarrone, libro primo (Bologna, 1623) and Intavolaturo di Liuto (Bologna, 1639), the latter published posthumously by his son Leonardo Maria Piccinini. The 1623 collection is of particular importance because of Piccinini's lengthy preface, which includes a detailed manual on performance, as well as claims to have invented the archlute (Piccinini also made important modifications to the chitarrone). Piccinini concentrated on toccatas, courantes and galliards, as well as different kinds of variations. No other works by Piccinini are known; his music for La selva sin amor, the first opera performed in Spain, composed by his brother Filippo Piccinini is lost.

Campini was born at Bologna, Emilia-Romagna. In 1931 he wrote a proposal for the Italian Air Ministry on the value of jet propulsion and in 1932 demonstrated a jet-powered boat in Venice. With support of the Air Ministry, he began work with Italian aircraft manufacturer Caproni to develop a jet plane, the Campini Caproni CC.2, which first flew in 1940. The "Thermojet" that Campini developed to propel this aircraft is substantially different from the jet engines of today. Campini's engine used an ordinary piston engine to compress air which was then mixed with fuel and ignited. Modern jets are based on the turbojet principle, but Campini's jet was nevertheless a true jet, since it was the reactive force of the burning exhaust gases that pushed the plane along. After World War II, Campini emigrated to the US at the request of Preston Tucker (famous for the Tucker'48), who wanted Campini to help him with his new corporation. Tucker asked Campini to both help him develop a turbine powered car, and also used his fame to attempt to land a US Air Force development contract for the Tucker Corporation. After the Tucker Corporation folded in 1948, he worked on a number of military projects including the YB-49 flying-wing bomber. He died in Milan in 1980.

Born in West Berlin	Carsten Peter Thiede OCF KStJ (8 August 1952 – 14 December 2004) was a German archaeologist and New Testament scholar. He was also a member of PEN and a Knight of Justice in the Order of St John. He taught as Professor of New Testament Times and History at the Staatsunabhängige Theologische Hochschule (STH) in Basel and at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beersheba, Israel. He often advanced theories that conflicted with the consensus of academic and theological scholarship. Born in West Berlin, Thiede studied Comparative Literature and History there before procuring a German National Scholarship Foundation Research Fellow position at Queen's College at Oxford University in 1976, where he attained a Blue for volleyball, which he had played in the German Volleyball Premier League. In 1978, he became a Senior Lecturer in Comparative Literature at Geneva, where he drew inspiration from his fellow "comparativist", George Steiner. Drawn to the subject of early Christianity because of his background as a linguist and his expertise in medieval Latin philology, the study of the origins of Christianity came to form his life's work. For a number of years into the early '90s Thiede worked with various broadcasting companies, including BBC Radio and ERF, and as an editor at the Brockhaus publishing company. Thiede was best known for his interpretation of some of the Greek Dead Sea Scrolls fragments, including the identification of the small 7Q5 papyrus fragment (illustration) as a fragment of the Gospel of Mark. He supported O’Callaghan’s controversial claims that several papyrus fragments from Qumran Cave 7 are actually Christian New Testament texts from pre AD 70. In December 1994, Thiede redated the Magdalen papyrus together with former deputy editor of The Sunday Telegraph and current editor of The Spectator, Matthew d'Ancona, which bears a fragment in Greek of the Gospel of Matthew, to the latter part of the 1st century on palaeographical grounds; this too provoked much debate and was highly publicised, most notably with a front page headline in The Times. By attempting to make his material more accessible to the general public he was often accused of being a popular science writer. In The Quest for the True Cross, also co-written with d'Ancona, Thiede argued that the Titulus Crucis could in fact be part of Jesus' cross, based on his palaeographic study of the writing, though it is considered to be a medieval forgery by many scholars. Thiede is particularly noted for his research into early Christianity, notably Peter and Paul. For the last seven years of his life, Thiede also worked for the Israel Antiquities Authority repairing damage to the Dead Sea Scrolls and excavating the biblical location of Emmaus. A devout Anglican who was ordained priest in 2000, he was also Chaplain to Her Majesty's Forces in spite of being a German citizen. He died in Paderborn suddenly at the age of 52 from a heart attack.

On the death of Mamiani in 1885 he became editor of the Filosofia delle scuole italiane, whose title he changed to Rivista italiana di filosofia. He wrote both on psychology and on metaphysics, but is known especially as a historian of philosophy. His original work is eclectic, combining the psychology of his teachers, Jules Simon, Saisset and Mamiani, with the idealism of Rosmini and Gioberti. Among his works may be mentioned:  * Studii sulla coscienza  * Il Fenomeno nelle sue relazioni con la sensazione  * Della idea del vera  * Della filosofia del diritto presso Aristotile (1885)  * Il Genio di Aristotile  * La Psicologia di Pietro Pomponazzi (1877)  * most important, Essai sur l'histoire de la philosophie en Italie au XIX' siècle (Paris, 1869)  * La Psychologie de l'association depuis Hobbes jusqu'à nos jours 12px This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

His scientific work was chiefly concerned with galvanism, anatomy and its medical applications, with the construction and illumination of lighthouses, and with experiments for preserving human life and material objects from destruction by fire. He wrote in French and English in addition to his native Italian. In recognition of his merits, the emperor of Austria made him a knight of the Iron Crown and a councillor of state at Milan, where he died. He bequeathed a considerable sum to found a school of natural science for artisans at Bologna.

Owing to the poverty of the family, he studied with his uncle Bartolomeo Maggi, (1477-1552), a famous surgeon who was a lecturer at the University of Bologna as well as court physician to Julius III. He held this uncle in such high esteem that he assumed his surname, calling himself Giulio Cesare Aranzio Maggio. He was admitted to the University of Padua where he made his first discovery in 1548, at the age of nineteen, when he described the elevator muscle of the upper eyelid. Later, at the University of Bologna, he received a doctorate in medicine in 1556 and was appointed a lecturer in medicine and surgery shortly thereafter at the age of twenty-seven. In 1570, surgery and anatomy were separated into separate professorships at his instigation and he held the newly created chair in anatomy for thirty-three years until his death at Bologna in 1589. From Aranzio came the first correct account of the anatomical peculiarities of the fetus, and he was the first to show that the muscles of the eye do not, as was previously imagined, arise from the dura mater but from the margin of the optic hole. He also, after considering the anatomical relations of the cavities of the heart, the valves and the great vessels, corroborated the views of Realdo Colombo regarding the course which the blood follows in passing from the right to the left side of the heart. Aranzio was the first anatomist to describe distinctly the inferior cornua of the ventricles of the cerebrum, who recognizes the objects by which they are distinguished, and who gives them the name by which they are still known ( hippocampus ) in 1564; and his account is more minute and perspicuous than that of the authors of the subsequent century. He speaks at length of the choroid plexus, and gives a detailed description of the fourth ventricle, under the name of cistern of the cerebellum, as a discovery of his own. He also was the first to discover that the blood of mother and fetus remain separate during pregnancy. As Professor of Anatomy and Surgery at the University of Bologna from 1556, he established anatomy as a major branch of medicine for the first time. Aranzi combined anatomy with a description of pathological processes, based largely on his own research, Galen, and the work of his contemporary Italians. Aranzi discovered the 'Nodules of Aranzio' in the semilunar valves of the heart and wrote the first description of the superior levator palpebral and the coracobrachialis muscles. His books (in Latin) covered surgical techniques for many conditions, including hydrocephalus, nasal polyp, goitre and tumours to phimosis, ascites, haemorrhoids, anal abscess and fistulae.

Vitali was born in Bologna and spent all of his life in the Emilian region, moving to Modena in 1674. His teacher in his early years was probably Maurizio Cazzati (1616–1678), maestro di cappella at the main church in Bologna, San Petronio Basilica from 1657 to 1671. The first documented evidence of Vitali’s musical activities appears in the records of the San Petronio orchestra for 1658, when he is listed under the title ‘Violoni’, referring to the cello/bass instrument that he played (to be discussed below). Vitali remained in the orchestra until 1673, when he took up an appointment as maestro di cappella at the chapel of the Confraternità del Rosario, Bologna. His first publication, Opus 1 (1666), tells us that he was a member of the Accademia dei Filaschisi. This musical institution, which had been established in 1633, disbanded in 1666 when most of its members joined the Accademia Filarmonica. Vitali is also listed as a member of the Accademia Filarmonica in 1666, the year of its founding. The academy archives record various details of its members, including where they came from (if not from Bologna) and their dates of birth and death. Vitali’s death date is here recorded as 12 October 1692. Vitali never reached a higher position in Bologna than that of maestro di cappella at the Santissimo Rosario. There may be several reasons for this. By the time he left Bologna and moved to Modena he had not published any vocal music and is known to have composed only two vocal works, the oratorios Agare and Il Gefte. He was also, significantly, not an organist – unlike the vast majority of maestri di cappella in Bologna during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is unlikely, therefore, that even if Vitali had stayed longer in Bologna he would have been offered the job of maestro di cappella at San Petronio, the most important musical position in the city. In 1674 Vitali attained the position of one of two vice-maestri di cappella at the secular court of the Este family in Modena. Unlike Modena, Bologna was part of the Papal States, under the administration of Rome. The Church’s influence was strong (around one hundred and fifty religious institutions at the end of the seventeenth century). Music and the theatre were evidently strongly supported and patronised by the court under Duke Francesco II (1660–1694). Here, Vitali must have witnessed a greater diversity of musical styles and genres than he had been exposed to in Bologna. The period between 1680 and 1685 saw his most productive time: he published six collections of music and was promoted to maestro di cappella in 1684. He was succeeded in this position by the opera composer Antonio Giannettini (1648–1721) in 1686. His last two publications, Artificii musicali, Opus 13 (1689), and the posthumously published Sonate da camera, Opus 14 (1692), make no mention of Vitali holding any official position, although the fact that both publications are dedicated to members of the Este family implies that he maintained links with the court.

Born in Bologna, he was grandson to Giovanni Filoteo Achillini and grand-nephew to Alessandro Achillini. He was professor of jurisprudence for several years at his native Bologna, Parma, and Ferrara, with the highest reputation. So much admiration did his learning excite, that inscriptions to his honor were placed in the schools in his lifetime. Achillini went to Rome, where he obtained great promises of preferment from popes and cardinals, but they proved only promises. Odoardo Farnese, duke of Parma, engaged him however on very liberal terms, to occupy the chair of law in his university. Achillini was a particular friend of Giambattista Marino, whose style in poetry he imitated, adopting the same strain of turgid metaphors, absurd thoughts, and points, which obtained the applause of that age. A canzone, which he addressed to Louis XIII on the birth of the dauphin, is said to have been rewarded by Cardinal Richelieu with a gold chain or collar worth 1000 crowns; this reward was not given, as some have asserted, for the famous sonnet beginning, "Sudate o fuochi, a preparar metalli;" and which was parodied by Crudeli in one beginning, "Sudate o forni, a preparar pagnotte," (Sweat, O ye ovens! in preparing cakes!)

Born in Bologna, Raimondi studied at the Music Conservatory of his native city with Antonio Melandri, and Gennaro Barra-Caracciolo and in Mantua with Ettore Campogalliani. He made his stage debut in 1947 in Rigoletto at the Teatro Consorziale in Budrio, a small town near Bologna. The following year he made his debut at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, as Ernesto in Donizetti's Don Pasquale. After singing throughout Italy (notably in Florence, in a rare 1952 revival of Rossini's Armida, opposite Maria Callas), he made guest appearances in Nice, Marseille, Monte-Carlo, Paris, and London. His La Scala début occurred in 1956, as Alfredo in La Traviata, again opposite Callas, in the famed Luchino Visconti production. He took part in another famous Visconti-Callas production, as Percy in Donizetti's Anna Bolena, in 1957. Later he participated in many important revivals at La Scala, including two Rossini works: Mosè in Egitto in 1958, and Semiramide, opposite Joan Sutherland, in 1962. In particular he was much appreciated for his skill with high-lying lyric tenor roles such as Arnoldo in Rossini's Guglielmo Tell, Arturo in Bellini's I Puritani, Fernando in yet another Donizetti piece, La favorita, Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor, and the Duke in Rigoletto. In 1957 Raimondi made his debut at the Vienna State Opera where he continued to perform until 1977. There he sang Alfredo (La traviata), the Duke (Rigoletto), Cavaradossi (Tosca), Pinkerton (Madama Butterfly), and Riccardo (Un ballo in maschera). In 1963 he was Rodolfo to Mirella Freni's Mimí in Franco Zeffirelli's legendary production of La bohème, with Herbert von Karajan conducting. His American debut was at the San Francisco Opera in 1957; he also appeared at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, in 1959. He made his Metropolitan Opera début on 29 September 1965 as Rodolfo in La bohème, opposite another débutante, Mirella Freni. Other roles at the Met included Edgardo, Faust in the Gounod opera (this being among his few ventures into non-Italian vocal territory), and some Puccini: once more, Cavaradossi and Pinkerton. During the 1970s, Raimondi expanded his repertory and added roles such as Pollione in Norma, and Gennaro in yet another Donizetti piece, Lucrezia Borgia, in which role he appeared opposite Leyla Gencer and Montserrat Caballé. He also appeared in some of Verdi's less frequently performed operas such as I masnadieri, I Vespri Siciliani, and Simon Boccanegra. Raimondi made disappointingly few studio recordings, given the length of his career and the sheer number of internationally distinguished opera houses where he sang. Even recorded versions of his live performances are not as frequent as they could and should have been. The most famous of his surviving recorded interpretations is probably La Traviata, opposite Renata Scotto and Ettore Bastianini. He also appeared in a film version of La bohème with Freni, and conducted by Karajan. Gianni Raimondi was married to the Italian soprano Gianna Dal Sommo and in retirement spent much of his time at his seaside villa in Riccione.

Educated at the Accademia di Brera in Milan, he has since worked in both London and Paris. His art is influenced by Pop Art. Adami was born in Bologna. In 1945, at the age of ten, he began to study painting under the instruction of Felice Carena. He was accepted into the Brera Academy (Accademia di Brera) in 1951, and there studied as a draughtsman until 1954 in the studio of Achille Funi. In 1955 he went to Paris, where he met and was influenced by Roberto Matta and Wifredo Lam. His first solo exhibition came in 1959 in Milan. In his early career, Adami's works were expressionistic, but by the time of his second exhibition in 1964 at Kassel, he had developed a style of painting reminiscent of French cloisonnism, featuring regions of flat color bordered by black lines. Unlike Gauguin, however, Adami's subjects were highly stylized and often presented in fragments, as seen in Telescoping Rooms (1965). In the 1970s, Adami began to address politics in his art, and incorporated subject matter such as modern European history, literature, philosophy, and mythology. In 1971, he and his brother Gioncarlo created the film Vacances dans le désert. In 1974 he illustrated a Helmut Heissenbuttel poem, Occasional Poem No. 27. Ten Lessons on the Reich with ten original lithographs {Gallerie Maeght}. In 1975, the philosopher Jacques Derrida devoted a long essay, "+R: Into the Bargain", to Adami's work, using an exhibition of Adami's drawings as a pretext to discuss the function of "the letter and the proper name in painting", with reference to "narration, technical reproduction, ideology, the phoneme, the biographeme, and politics". There were four retrospective exhibits of Adami's work between 1985 and 1998. They were held in Paris, the Centre Julio-Gonzalez de Valence (Spain), Tel Aviv, and Buenos Aires. In 2010, the Boca Raton Museum of Art devoted a special exhibit to Adami's paintings and drawings. The Galerie Daniel Templon has represented Adami in Europe since 2004.

He can be described as painting during both Mannerist and early-Baroque periods. He was born in Bologna, where he initially apprenticed with an unknown painter by the name of Spinelli, then the Mannerist painter Bartolomeo Passarotti, but also worked with Bartolomeo Cesi. In 1592, he joined the Carracci studio or the Academy of the Incamminati, and remained attached to Ludovico Carracci for many years. In 1604, he worked with Ludovico to fresco Stories of San Mauro, San Benedetto and others in the cloister of San Michele in Bosco. In 1607, he collaborated with Lionello Spada and Francesco Brizio in frescoes for the Palazzo Bonfioli, in Bologna. In 1610, he visited Rome, remaining under the patronage of Cardinal Facchinetti, and befriended Domenichino. In 1612, he completed the frescoes left unfinished by Bernardino Poccetti in a chapel of the Certosa di Galluzzo, near Florence. He painted the main altarpiece for the church of Santa Maria in Guadi in San Giovanni in Persiceto. He returned to Bologna in 1614, and soon travels with Francesco Albani to work in Mantua. He is said to have spent so much time in hunting, fishing, and the delights of the countryside, that he neglected painting, though his biography shows him to be exceedingly prolific in altarpieces. Among his pupils were Sebastiano Brunetti, Antonio Randa, and Fra Bonaventura Bisi.

In 1569 the Senate of the University of Bologna created an extraordinary chair in surgery for him with responsibility to teach anatomy as well and where a statue of him is housed at the Anatomical Theatre of the Archiginnasio. Later he is believed to have taught at the Sapienza University of Rome although he is not listed on the roll there. Nevertheless, he is known to have had considerable success in Rome both as a physician and as a surgeon and his memorial plaque in that city refers to his great skill in removing stones. He died in Rome. He is best remembered for his work on the cranial nerves. He was the first to examine the brain from its base upwards, in contrast with previous dissections which had been performed from the top downwards. In 1573 he published this new method of dissecting the brain whereby he separated the brain from the skull and began the dissection from the base. Varolio described many of the brain's structures for the first time including the pons or pons Varolii which is a reflex center of respiration and a communication bridge between spinal cord and brain, the crura cerebri and the ileocecal valve. Another area of interest to him was the mechanism of erectile function. Although the “Musculi erectores penis” (i.e. Mm. bulbospongiosi and ischicavernosi) had already been described by Galen in the 2nd century A.D., this knowledge was lost by the time of Varolio, who re-discovered them and gave a surprisingly accurate description of the mechanism of erection although his inaccurate attribution of erection to "erector muscles" continued to be believed by most anatomists for three centuries.

He was born to a family of noble ancestry, but limited resources, in Bologna. His father's first name was Pompeo, and his mother, Maddalena Quaini. In Bologna, he studied first under Battista Cairo and later under Francesco Albani, to whom he remained closely allied, and was his most famous disciple. His first noted commission was a St Paul exorcising demon for the church of the Gesu in Bologna. For a hall dedicated to the Farnese in the Palazzo Publico, he painted with Taruffi, depicting the Francis, king of France, curing Scrofula on his entry to Bologna and the Entry of Paul III Farnese to Bologna'. He was, however, also strongly influenced by the genius of Correggio, and by the masterworks by Melozzo da Forlì. For instance, his masterpiece, the Assumption of the Virgin, around the cupola of the church of the Madonna del Fuoco at Forlì, is inspired by the Correggio's frescoes in the cupola of the Cathedral of Parma and by the Melozzo's perspective from down to up. These frescoes occupied Cignani for some twenty years. In 1681, Cignani returned to Bologna from Parma. He opened an accademia del nudo for painting from models and had as one of his pupils Giuseppe Maria Crespi. He had some of the defects of his masters: his elaborate finish and his audacious artificiality in the use of color and in composition mark Albani's influence. Despite that, he imparted to his work more of an intellectual character than his mentors. As a man Cignani was eminently amiable, unassuming and generous. He accepted no honors offered him by the duke of Parma, but lived and died an artist. In 1686 he moved to Forlì, where he died. When the Accademia Clementina for Bolognese artists was founded in 1706, Cignani was posthumously elected Principe in absencia for life. His most famous pictures, in addition to the Assumption already cited, are the Entry of Paul III into Bologna; the Francis I Touching for Kings Evil; a Power of Love, painted under a fine ceiling by Agostino Carracci, on the walls of a room in the ducal palace at Parma; an Adam and Eve (at The Hague); and two of Joseph and Potiphars Wife (at Dresden and Copenhagen). His son Felice Cignani (1660–1724) and nephew Paolo Cignani (1709–1764) were also painters. His most noted pupils were Marcantonio Franceschini and Federico Bencovich.

It is possible that he was born in Bracara Augusta (now Braga), then capital of the Roman province of Gallaecia, and which would be the capital of the Kingdom of the Suebi by his death. Although there are some questions regarding his biography, such as his exact date of birth, it is known that he was a person of some prestige from a cultural point of view, as he had contact with the greatest figures of his time such as Saint Augustine of Hippo and Saint Jerome. In order to meet with them Orosius travelled to cities on the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, such as Hippo Regius and Alexandria. These journeys defined his life and intellectual output. Orosius did not just discuss theological matters with Saint Augustine; he also collaborated with him on the book City of God. In addition, in 415 he was chosen to travel to Palestine in order to exchange information with other intellectuals. He was also able to participate in a Church Council meeting in Jerusalem on the same trip and he was entrusted with transporting the relics of Saint Stephen. The date of his death is also unclear, although it appears to have not been earlier than 418, when he finished one of his books, or later than 423. He wrote a total of three books, of which his most important is his Seven Books of History Against the Pagans (Latin: Historiarum Adversum Paganos Libri VII), considered to be one of the books with the greatest impact on historiography during the period between antiquity and the Middle Ages, as well as being one of the most important Hispanic books of all time. Part of its importance comes from the fact that the author shows his historiographical methodology. The book is a historical narration focusing on the pagan peoples from the earliest time up until the time Orosius was alive. Orosius was a highly influential figure both for the dissemination of information (History Against the Pagans was one of the main sources of information regarding Antiquity that was used up to the Renaissance) and for rationalising the study of history (his methodology greatly influenced later historians).

He studied at the University of Coimbra and took the degree of licentiate about 1600. He worked for the Duke of Vila Real, probably being his sons' teacher. He visited Lisbon from time to time, and tradition has it that he died by drowning on his way there. Though his first book, a little volume of verse (Romances) published in 1596, and his last, a rhymed welcome to King Philip III, published in 1623, are written in Spanish he composed his eclogues and prose pastorals entirely in Portuguese, and thereby did a rare service to his country at a time when, owing to the Philippine Dynasty, Castilian was the language preferred by "polite society" and by men of letters. The characteristics of his prose style are harmony, purity and elegance, and he was one of Portugal's leading writers. A disciple of the Italian school, his verses were free from imitations of classical models. Their popularity may be seen by the fact that the Primavera went through seven editions in the 17th century and nine in all, a large number for so limited a market as that of Portugal. An edition of his collected works was published in one volume in Lisbon in 1723, and another in four volumes, but less complete, appeared there in 1774. He died drowned near Santarém while in voyage to Lisbon by river when the boat he was in was sunk by the current.

He was actually born in Caesarea (now known as Anazarbus), but was mistakenly placed in Corycus by Suidas; both cities were in the Roman province of Cilicia. He composed a series of didactic poems in Greek hexameter: one on hunting (Κυνηγετικά, Kynēgetiká), one on fishing (Ἁλιευτικά, Halieutiká), and one on bird catching (Ἰξευτικά, Ixeutiká). The surviving work on hunting is now believed to be the work of a different Oppian and the surviving prose paraphrase of the work on birding is now thought to describe a work composed by the Dionysus whom the Suda mention as the author of a treatise on rocks (Λιθιακά, Lithiaká). According to an anonymous biographer, Oppian's father, having incurred the displeasure of a colleague of Marcus Aurelius named Lucius Verus by neglecting to pay his respects to him when he visited Rome, was banished to Malta. Oppian, who had accompanied his father into exile, returned after the death of Verus (AD 169) and presented his poems to Marcus Aurelius, who was so pleased with them that he gave the author a piece of gold for each line, took him into favor, and pardoned his father. Oppian subsequently returned to his native country but died of the plague shortly afterwards at the early age of thirty. His contemporaries erected a statue in his honor, with an inscription which is still extant, containing a lament for his premature death and a eulogy of his precocious genius. His poem on fishing, the Halieutica, is still extant. It is about 3500 lines and bears a dedication to Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus, placing it to the time of their joint rule.

Jonkman was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan where he attended the public schools. He graduated from the law department of the University of Michigan in 1914, was admitted to the bar the same year, and commenced practice in Grand Rapids. He served as assistant prosecutor of Kent County from 1915 to 1920, and as prosecuting attorney from 1929 to 1936. Following the death of U.S. Representative Carl E. Mapes, in December 1939, a special election was held on February 19, 1940 to fill the vacancy. Jonkman was elected as a Republican from Michigan's 5th congressional district to the 76th United States Congress, serving from February 19, 1940 to January 3, 1949. In the 1948 Republican primary, he was defeated for re-nomination by Gerald Ford, then 34 years old, who eventually served as the 38th President of the United States from 1974–1977. A confidential 1943 analysis of the House Foreign Affairs Committee by Isaiah Berlin for the British Foreign Office described Jonkman as the fourth of the Republican Opposition group on the committee. An agreeable man, shrewd, capable and very determined in his opposition to the Administration in both its foreign and domestic policies. Pure Isolationist before Pearl Harbour, and, in fact, typical of the Michigan Republican Bloc (whose most notorious member is Clare Hoffman). Seems convinced America is playing Santa Claus again in this war, and is doing his best to obtain facts and figures which will show up this fact. A Methodist; age 59. Nationalist. Bartel J. Jonkman had become unpopular largely due to his isolationist position on foreign policy. He resumed the practice of law and died in Grand Rapids. He was interred there in Woodlawn Cemetery.

It concerned the Papal States' seizure from a Jewish family in Bologna	The Mortara case (Italian: caso Mortara) was an Italian cause célèbre that captured the attention of much of Europe and the United States in the 1850s and 1860s. It concerned the Papal States' seizure from a Jewish family in Bologna of one of their children, six-year-old Edgardo Mortara, on the basis of a former servant's testimony that she had administered emergency baptism to the boy when he fell sick as an infant. Mortara grew up as a Catholic under the protection of Pope Pius IX—who refused his parents' desperate pleas for his return—and eventually became a priest. The domestic and international outrage against the pontifical state's actions may have contributed to its downfall amid the unification of Italy. In late 1857, Bologna's inquisitor Father Pier Feletti heard that Anna Morisi, who had worked in the Mortara house for six years, had secretly baptised Edgardo when she had thought he was about to die as a baby. The Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition held that this made the child irrevocably a Catholic and, because the Papal States forbade the raising of Christians by members of other faiths, ordered that he be taken from his family and brought up by the Church. Police came to the Mortara home late on 23 June 1858 and removed Edgardo the following evening. After the child's father was allowed to visit him during August and September, two starkly different narratives emerged—one told of a boy who wanted to return to his family and the faith of his ancestors, while the other described a child who had learned the catechism perfectly and wanted his parents to become Christians as well. International protests mounted, but the Pope would not be moved. After pontifical rule in Bologna ended in 1859, Father Feletti was prosecuted for his role in Mortara's seizure, but was acquitted when the court decided he had simply followed orders. With the Pope as a substitute father, Mortara trained for the priesthood in Rome until the Kingdom of Italy captured the city in 1870, ending the Papal States. Leaving the country, he was ordained in France three years later at the age of 21. Father Mortara spent most of his life outside Italy and died in Belgium in 1940, aged 88. For many, the Vatican's actions encapsulated all that was wrong with the Papal States and exposed pontifical rule as an anachronism. Several historians highlight the affair as one of the most significant events of Pius IX's papacy, and juxtapose his handling of it in 1858 with the loss of most of his territory a year later. The case notably altered the policy of the French Emperor Napoleon III, who shifted from opposing the movement for Italian unification to actively supporting it. The traditional Italian historiography of unification does not give much prominence to the Mortara case, which by the late 20th century was remembered mostly by Jewish scholars, but a 1997 study by the American historian David Kertzer has marked the start of a wider re-examination.

Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan	Rexford Raymond "Rex" Cherryman (October 30, 1896 – August 10, 1928) was an American actor of the stage and screen whose career was most prolific during the 1920s. Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Rex Cherryman attended Colgate University, (Hamilton, New York) in 1915-1916. He transferred to the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) in 1916. There he met fellow student Esther Louise Lamb. Esther and Rex were married February 9, 1918. They had one son, Rexford Raymond Cherryman, Jr., born October 10, 1925. Rexford, Jr. married Beatrice Wishard in 1950. They had two daughters: Ann Elizabeth Cherryman (born 1951) and Constance Lamb Cherryman (born 1954). Cherryman began his film career appearing in the 1919 comedic film In For Thirty Days as Count Dronsky, opposite popular leading lady of the silent film era, May Allison. The following year, Cherryman was chosen by the notable screen diva Alla Nazimova to appear opposite her as Thorne, in her penned dramatic film Madame Peacock. Cherryman and Nazimova developed a friendship and at Nazimova's request, he was cast in the role Gaston Rieux in the 1921 film that would possibly become his most recalled performance - 1921's Metro Pictures Corporation film adaptation of the Alexandre Dumas, fils novel La Dame aux Camélias, retitled as Camille. The film was an enormous critical and public success, placing Cherryman directly in the public consciousness. The film also starred Rudolph Valentino, Nazimova and Patsy Ruth Miller. Cherryman also appeared in the 1923 film Sunshine Trail in the role of Willis Duckworth. Cherryman's last film performance was a small role in the 1928 film Two Masters. In addition to films, Cherryman was frequently involved with Broadway and various summer stock productions including the Denham Theatre in Denver, and the Aladdin Theatre in San Francisco, where he first met Barbara Stanwyck. He made several notable appearances on the stage. Among them were the musical comedy Topsy and Eva which ran from 1924 through 1925, The Valley of Content in 1925, and the Willard Mack penned drama The Noose, which ran from 1926 through 1927. While performing in the The Noose, Cherryman had an affair with fellow cast member Stanwyck. The Noose would subsequently become one of the biggest hits of the season and help launch Stanwyck's career. Cherryman's last stint on Broadway was a starring role in the 1927 dramatic production of The Trial of Mary Dugan opposite actor Robert Cummings at the National Theatre. In August 1928, while sailing to France to read for a play in Paris, Cherryman contracted septic poisoning and died in Le Havre, France at the age of 31. His body was returned to Hollywood. His cremated remains are at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California. Esther's remains are in the same vault.

From 1964 to 1977 he was the Sovrintendente or General Manager of the Teatro Comunale di Bologna and from 1977 through 1990 he was the Sovrintendente of La Scala. Badini created controversy as a result of the unorthodox methods he used to revitalize La Scala's finances, which had reportedly reached a 2.8 million dollar (US) deficit, such as the introduction of television cameras to record performances and allowing advertisements on the programmes. These innovations allowed the opera house to emerge from the deficit within two years of their implementation. Upon his 1990 departure from La Scala, Badini continued work in the Italian artistic community, becoming chairman of the National Theatre Organization in Italy and co-founding the Mozart Orchestra in Bologna, which he formed alongside former La Scala music director Claudio Abbado.

Pini studied law at the University of Bologna and served in World War I before joining the Bologna fascio in 1920. Following the establishment of the fascist state he became an important figure in the journalists syndicate along with the likes of Lando Ferretti and Telesio Interlandi. As a journalist he made his name as an editor for il Resto del Carlino (1928-1930) and Il Gazzettino (1936) before graduating to the editorship of Il Popolo d'Italia in December 1936. He retained this post until 1943, although in the Italian Social Republic Pini, who was a noted moderate, returned to the local Resto. He did however serve as an undersecretary in the Ministry of the Interior in 1944. Pini was most noted in Fascist Italy for his biography of Benito Mussolini, a hagiography from which Il Duce profited financially. It was translated by Luigi Villari into English as The Official Life on Benito Mussolini in 1939. After the Second World War he released an updated version of this book with Duilio Susmel whilst in 1950 he published Itinerario Tragica 1943/44 which was also pro-fascist in nature. His continuing justifications for fascism led him to far right politics in the post-war era and he was a founding member of the Italian Social Movement (MSI). Within the MSI he was part of the 'left-wing' tendency that sought to add socialist economics to their rhetoric and when his position was not adopted he left in January 1952 to help launch the Raggruppamento Sociale Repubblicano with Concetto Pettinato. Pini continued his career on the socialist fringes of the far right and frequently attacked the MSI in later years for forging links to regimes in Greece, South Africa and Portugal that he dismissed as reactionary.

Born in Bridgeport, Connecticut	Philip "Phil" Nastu (born March 8, 1955) is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher playing for the San Francisco Giants from 1978 to 1980. Born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, he attended Bassick High School and the University of Bridgeport before being signed by the Giants as free agent in 1976. Nastu began his professional baseball career in 1977 pitching for the Cedar Rapids Giants in the Midwest League and the Waterbury Giants in the Eastern League; the next season he was promoted to the AAA Phoenix Giants in Pacific Coast League. As a September call-up, Nastu made his MLB debut on September 15, 1978 when the Giants hosted the Cincinnati Reds at Candlestick Park. He pitched the final 2 innings in the 6–1 loss; although he surrendered a single and walk, no runs scored. His first decision, a loss, came on October 1 (the final game of the season) when the Houston Astros shutout the Giants, 3–0, in the Astrodome. Starting the game, he gave up runs in the first 3 innings before being removed for a pinch hitter in the 5th inning. Although Nastu began the 1979 season back with AAA Phoenix, he was recalled to the majors when John Montefusco was placed on the disabled list in late April. The season was the high-mark of his MLB career when he appeared in 25 games (14 as a starter) pitching 100 innings. After his call-up, he was the starting pitcher on April 30 at the Philadelphia Phillies but lost the 4–1 game, pitching 4 1⁄3 innings. On May 10 he also suffered the 3–0 loss after he gave up a 1st inning home run to the visiting Montreal Expos' Rodney Scott, who only hit 3 in his MLB career. His first victory came on May 15 at the same site as his first career loss when the Giants defeated the Astros, 8–1; pitching his only career complete game, he scattered 5 hits en route to the victory. His second victory came 9 days later hosting the Reds; with the visitors committing 4 errors, Nastu and the Giants posted a 2–1 victory. He suffered his third loss of the season on May 28 while hosting the Atlanta Braves; although he pitched 8 innings, the Giants were defeated 4–1. Again in 1980, Nastu opened the season with AAA Phoenix before being recalled in September. Used sparingly, he appeared in only 6 games, pitching 6 innings, finishing his MLB career on October 3, 1980. In the off season, he was traded (along with infielder Joe Strain) to the Chicago Cubs for outfielders Jesús Figueroa and Jerry Martin, and minor league infielder/outfielder Mike Turgeon as a player to be named later. Nastu's last professional appearances came in 1981 and 1982 when he played for the Midland Cubs, the AA affiliate of the Chicago Cubs in the Texas League, and the Charlotte O's, the AA affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles in the Southern League.

He was a native of Bologna. His Aristotelis loca mathematica ex universis ipsius operibus collecta et explicata, published in Bologna, appeared in 1615, in which Biancani discussed Aristotelian thought on floating bodies. The work suffered censorship whilst undergoing peer review, a common Jesuit practice. The reviewer, Giovanni Camerota, wrote: "It does not seem to be either proper or useful for the books of our members to contain the ideas of Galileo Galilei, especially when they are contrary to Aristotle." Biancani wrote his Sphaera mundi, seu cosmographia demonstrativa, ac facili methodo tradita in 1615. However, it was not published until 1619 in Bologna, after the Decree of the Congregation of the Index in 1616. In his Sphaera mundi, Biancani expounded on his belief that God had made the earth a perfect symmetrical world: the highest mountain on land had its proportional equivalent in the lowest depth of the ocean. The original earth emerged on the third day of the creation myth as a perfectly smooth sphere, Biancani reasoned. If not for the hand of God, "natural law" would have allowed the earth to remain in that form. Biancani believed, however, that God had created the depths of the sea and formed the mountains of the earth. Moreover, if left to "natural law," the earth would be consumed in water, in imitation of how it was created. However, the hand of God would intervene in order to cause the earth to be destroyed entirely by fire. The contents of the book are described in Latin as: Sphaera Mundi seu Cosmographia. Demonstrativa, ac facili Methodo tradita: In qua totius Mundi fabrica, una cum novis, Tychonis, Kepleri, Galilaei, aliorumque; Astronomorum adinventis continetur. Accessere I.

As evidenced in the table of contents, this work also presented a summary of the discoveries made with the telescope by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, Galileo, Copernicus, and others. The censorship of Biancani's previous work affected the manner in which he wrote Sphaera mundi. "But that this opinion [heliocentrism] is false," Biancani wrote, during his discussion on Copernican and Keplerian theories, "and should be rejected (even though it is established by better proofs and arguments) has nevertheless become much more certain in our day when it has been condemned by the authority of the Church as contrary to Sacred Scripture" (Sphaera, IV, 37). The work not only included studies on the natural phenomenon of the echo and on sundials, but also included a diagram of the moon. Giuseppe Biancani's map was not drawn up in support of new Copernican ideas but those berthed in traditional geocentric cosmology and in support of Aristotelian thought. Biancani disagreed with Galileo, who believed in the existence of lunar mountains. In a 1611 letter to Christoph Grienberger (after whom the Gruemberger crater is named), Biancani wrote of his certainty that there could not be any mountains on the moon. Biancani opined that the Copernican system was of opinionem falsam... ac rejeciendam. Nevertheless, Biancani remained ambivalent in the midst of the Scientific Revolution, as he cited Galileo's opinions on the surface of the moon while also discussing those of the ancients, such as Posidonius and Cleomedes. Biancani's Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria discusses how to make a perfect sundial, with accompanying illustrations.

Jenkins [״Jenks״] (born September 18, 1934) is a former catcher who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m), 140 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, created by Chicago Cubs’ owner Philip K. Wrigley in anticipation of losing male players to the World War II draft, gave a new name to the baseball game. Since its 1943 season opener, the circuit developed a select group of women that changed the ballgame forever between the 1940s and 1950s. Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Marilyn Jenkins played for her hometown team Grand Rapids Chicks during the last three seasons of the league. In addition, she enjoyed one of the most pleasant experiences lived by any player in the league's history. Jenkins was a modest but dedicated ballplayer who earned the responsibility of learning the game correctly at a very early age. She started a long time relation of ten years with the Chicks when she was 10 years old, and stayed with them until the league folded after the 1954 season. Marilyn was in grade school when she sneaked out of class to serve as a bat girl for her home team. When she was 13, the team allowed her to practice with them on the field. She always used to arrive very early to the ballpark and quickly learned to catch a ball during batting practice. When her father died in 1947 the Chicks provided a strong support for her and her mother. Then, when the team won the champion title in that season she felt comforted and happy again. Four years later, she turned 17 and was ready to start playing with the team. I learned a lot and idolized them, of course, she explained in an interview. Jenkins opened 1952 with the Chicks, serving as a third-string catcher behind Lavonne Paire and Mamie Redman. She hit a .133 batting average in just 18 games. In her second year, she shared duties with Redman after Paire's departure to the Racine Belles. ״Jenks״ improved her average up to .207 in 69 games, while committing only eight errors in 292 fielding chances for a .972 mark. In the 1954 season the league adopted new rules of play, making the game much like Major League Baseball. The ball was reduced from 10 inches to 9 inches, while the pitching distance increased from 56 to 60 feet. In her first at-bat of the season, Jenkins smashed the new ball over the fence for the only home run of her career, which was cut short about halfway through the season due to health issues. A .192 career hitter, Jenkins also played in seven postseason games and was a member of the 1953 champion team, to achieve her childhood dreams of playing baseball for her hometown Chicks. A sure handed catcher, she received in 113 games and posted a fielding average of .960 (17 errors in 426 chances). She earned an additional distinction for being the only Grand Rapids native playing on the team. After baseball, Jenkins fulfilled a wide variety of jobs. She entered the healthcare field as a radiologic technologist, and years later offered paralegal services until 1980, when started an estate sales business that she attended for the next two decades. In her spare time she became an avid golfer. Since 1988 she is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The ceremony received even more attention when the Penny Marshall's film A League of Their Own, starring Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell, was released in 1992. To be cast in the film, actresses could not just look the part; they had to have the baseball skills too, according to Marshall. In 2010, Jenkins was among other 50 AAGPBL former players honored at Comerica Park before a Detroit Tigers' game against the Chicago White Sox. Jenkins and her AAGPBL pals also had a lunch cruise aboard the Detroit Princess Riverboat, in addition to a banquet and players meeting. It was a heck of a lot of fun, she said. At the time, none of us really thought we were doing something out of the ordinary. We just loved to play baseball. At age 82, Jenkins is still looking forward to catching up with some of her old friends and teammates. It will be a great experience, she suggested. We're going to have a blast. Marilyn Jenkins still resides in her home town of Grand Rapids.

Born in Bridgeport, Connecticut	Elise Irene Reynolds (born 25 March 1969) is a former Dutch cricketer who played sixteen women's One Day Internationals (ODIs) for the Dutch national side, including at the 1997 and 2000 World Cups. Born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to Dutch-American parents, Reynolds attended school in England and the Netherlands, where she was introduced to cricket. Before debuting for the Dutch national side, she played club cricket for the VRA Amsterdam women's side, and was also involved in coaching at the club, based in Amstelveen. Reynolds made her ODI debut for the Netherlands in July 1997. Her debut came at the Mikkelberg-Kunst-und-Cricket Center in Hattstedt, Germany, in the first match of the Dutch team's inaugural series against the Danish national side. A right-arm fast-medium bowler, she took 1/12 from eight overs on debut, her only wicket being Danish opener Karin Mikkelsen. Reynolds did not play the second ODI against Denmark, but was selected for all three ODIs played during the November 1997 Dutch tour of Sri Lanka, which preceded the 1997 World Cup in India. She played in only two of the five matches that the Netherlands played at the tournament, against New Zealand and Sri Lanka, with the team reaching the quarter-finals for the first and only time. Reynolds' greatest success came at the 1999 European Cricket Championship, held in Denmark. She conceded only 49 runs from 25.2 overs at the tournament, finishing with an economy rate of 1.93 runs per over. Against Denmark, she took 3/9 from 10 overs, which included five maiden overs. Despite her efforts, the Danish team won the match by three wickets, with the Dutchwomen having earlier been bowled out for 88 runs. At the 2000 World Cup, hosted by New Zealand, Reynolds played in six of the Netherlands' seven matches, missing only the game against Ireland. She bowled more overs than any other Dutch fast bowler, with only medium-pacer Teuntje de Boer and off-spinners Carolien Salomons and Caroline de Fouw bowling more than her. However, Reynolds failed to take a single wicket at the tournament, conceding 163 runs. The Dutch team's final match against Australia, an eventual finalist, was her last at ODI level. Outside of playing cricket, Reynolds is a freelance Dutch–English translator, and also a painter, having exhibited in several Amsterdam venues.

He participated in 8 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on May 22, 1955. He achieved 2 podiums, and scored a total of 5 championship points. Significantly younger than the majority of the drivers around at the time, Perdisa often gave his car to his more experienced team-mates when they encountered troubles. This happened, for example, on the 11th lap of the 1956 Belgian Grand Prix, Stirling Moss lost the right rear wheel of his Maserati. Moss brought his car to a stop and ran a quarter of a mile back to the pits where he took over Perdisa's Maserati, which he drove to the finish. In March 1957 Perdisa withdrew from the upcoming 12 Hours of Sebring after the death of his team-mate Eugenio Castellotti. Castellotti died at the Modena Autodrome when he crashed a Ferrari he was testing for the event. Although Perdisa initially claimed he was giving up racing for some time because of the shock he experienced when Castellotti died, he subsequently retired for good. Perdisa was Castellotti's closest friend. After his retirement, Perdisa hit the news again in September 1957 when he rushed Juan Manuel Fangio and his wife, Andrea, to a hospital in Bologna. The couple had been thrown from their 2.5 litre Lancia Aurelia while trying to avoid a truck entering the highway. Travelling at close to 100 mph, Fangio's car had smashed into a utility pole, although he and his wife only sustained bruises.

He was a putative son of Antongaleazzo Bentivoglio, although his mother, the Sienese Lina Canigiani, was said to be uncertain of the boy's paternity and the matter was decided by dice. He was named Annibale after the Carthaginian general. As a child, he was exiled from his native city due to his father's strong anti-Papal stance, and lived an errant life during the years of his youth. In 1438, he returned in Bologna, contributing to its liberation from the alien Milanese Visconti rule. In 1442 however, he was imprisoned by the Perugian condotierro Niccolò Piccinino (at that time at war with the Duke of Milan) in the castle of Varano, from where he was later freed in 1443 by Tideo and Galeazzo Marescotti. Bentivoglio was then made effective ruler of Bologna, but was stabbed to death less than two years later by a member of a rival family, Battista Canelloni, with the silent support of Pope Eugene IV. He was quickly succeeded in the government of Bologna by a vague putative cousin, Sante Bentivoglio, who was also made the sole tutor of his infant son Giovanni, born from his marriage with Donnina Visconti. An equestrian statue of Annibale I Bentivoglio is ascribed to the Dalmatian Early Renaissance sculptor Niccolò dell'Arca.

His family name is also spelled Passerotti or Passarotto. He traveled to Rome in the mid-16th century, where he worked under Girolamo Vignola and Taddeo Zuccari. Upon returning to Bologna, he accumulated a large studio, and influenced many Bolognese who would later play a role in the rise of the Baroque. Annibale Carracci (whose brother Agostino studied with Passerotti) was influenced by Passerotti's genre scenes in a select set of paintings (such as The Beaneater and The Butcher's Shop, the latter being originally attributed to Passerotti). Lucio Massari and Francesco Brizzi were among his pupils. Four of Passerotti's sons, including Ventura, Aurelio, Tiburzio and Passarotto were painters.

Artusi was one of the most famous reactionaries in musical history, fiercely condemning the new style developing around 1600, the innovations of which defined the early Baroque era. He was also a scholar and cleric at the Congregation San Salvatore at Bologna, and remained throughout his life devoted to his teacher Gioseffo Zarlino (the principal music theorist of the late sixteenth century). When Vincenzo Galilei first attacked Zarlino in the Dialogo of 1581, it provoked Artusi to defend his teacher and the style he represented. The most famous episode of Artusi's career, and one of the most famous episodes in the history of music criticism, occurred in 1600 and 1603 when he attacked the "crudities" and "license" shown in the works of a composer he initially refused to name. (It was Claudio Monteverdi). Monteverdi replied in the introduction to his fifth book of madrigals (1605) with his discussion of the division of musical practice into two streams: what he called prima pratica, and seconda pratica: prima pratica being the previous polyphonic ideal of the sixteenth century, with flowing counterpoint, prepared dissonance, and equality of voices; and seconda pratica being the new style of monody and accompanied recitative, which emphasized soprano and bass voices, and in addition showed the beginnings of conscious functional tonality. Artusi's major contribution to the literature of music theory was his book on dissonance in counterpoint. He recognized that there could be more dissonance than consonance in a developed piece of counterpoint, and he attempted to enumerate the reasons and uses for the dissonances, for example as settings of words expressing sorrow, pain, longing, terror. Ironically, the usage of Monteverdi in the seconda pratica largely agreed with his book, at least conceptually; the differences between Monteverdi's music and Artusi's theory were in the importance of the different voices, and the exact intervals used in shaping the melodic line. Artusi's compositions were few, and in a conservative style: one book of canzonette for four voices (published in Venice in 1598) and a Cantate Domino for eight voices (1599).

Reginald was an early follower of Dominic of Osma and entered the Dominican Order at San Nicolò delle Vigne in Bologna, where he was thereafter lived in a Dominican confraternity. The name by which he is commonly known may indicate either that he was born in Bologna or merely reflects his conversion and occupation there. His teaching at the University of Bologna influenced Ramon de Penyafort to convert to mendicancy in 1222. In 1221 he was one of twelve or thirteen friars sent to England by Dominic in one his last acts. Their work was to be not only missional but also foundational: they were commissioned to found Dominican houses in the British Isles, under the superiority of Gilbert of Fresnay. Reginald held no official post in the Isles, rather he travelled them widely, covering most of England and setting foot in Ireland. Reginald spent a few years in Britain before returning to Italy, where he entered the service of Pope Gregory IX as a penitentiary in Rome. It was he who received the news in Europe of the death of the Dominican master-general, Jordan of Saxony, off the coast of Palestine and brought it, with another Dominican papal penitentiary, Godfrey, to Paris and probably elsewhere in 1237. In 1247 Pope Innocent IV appointed Reginald Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of Ireland, perhaps on account of his knowledge of the English language, but also as a check on the power of Henry III of England over the Irish church. Two other Dominicans, David McKelly, Archbishop of Cashel, and Alan O'Sullivan, Bishop of Cloyne, already held posts in Ireland and may have influenced Innocent's choice of Reginald to replace the abdicating Albert Suerbeer. Reginald could speak no Irish. In 1252 Reginald paid his ad limina to Innocent IV, but was detained in Rome for a long period of time litigating on behalf of his diocese, which cases he eventually won.

He was mistaken by later historians for an architect. He built, but did not design, the library of the Basilica of San Domenico. Nadi was born in a house on the Via dei Pelacani (now Via G. Petroni) in the parish of San Vitale in Bologna. His father, Filippo di Domenico, was a tanner who died in 1427. That same year his mother, Chiara, remarried to Giacomo Senzabarba, a shoemaker. At the age of fifteen Nadi moved to Faenza in the following of the jurist Graziolo Accarisi, but two years later he returned to Bologna. Senzabarba refused to maintain him there and so within months he had moved into the house of Gaspare di Guido, where he was taught to read and write under a private instructor. In 1436 he began learning to work with wool and then apprenticed with a barber, but since his mother could not afford his training, he moved into masonry—arte del muro, the art of the wall—and found work with the master builder Bartolomeo Negri. Nadi's first work was the installation of the bell of the Palazzo d'Accursio (with the engineer Aristotele Fioravanti), completed, he proudly noted in his diary, on 16 May 1436. In July he joined the master builder Cristoforo Zani, and worked on the church of San Michele in Bosco. In 1440 he went to Ferrara to complete his training under Pietrobono Brasavola, the chief engineer of Niccolò III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara. He worked on the reliquary (arca) of the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli, construction on which was never complete owing to the destruction wrought by the earthquake of 1570. In 1442 Nadi returned to Bologna, to his stepfather's house in the parish of San Mamolo. In 1444 he married Catelina di Antonio di Bernardo, the daughter of a tailor from Florence, and in 1445 he moved to Prato to live with his in-laws. In 1450 his mother died and Nadi entered the company of masons of Prato. Around this time he had his first child, Filippo. During his time in Tuscany he was involved in a physical fight while trying to avenge a slight against his father. In 1452 Nadi returned to Bologna once more and began keeping his famous diario. In 1456 he entered the local masons' guild. He served his first of many terms as guild manager (massaro) in 1459. He also served once each as syndic (sindaco) and auditor (revisore). Around this time he had another son,Gianfrancesco, and a daughter, Maria. In total his wife bore him six children and had six abortions before her death in 1462. He then remarried to Francesca, who bore him a daughter, Bernardina, and a son, Girolamo, the only one of his children to learn their father's trade. In 1467 his eldest son and second wife died during an outbreak of plague. He married for a third time to Caterina, who had two children from a prior marriage. His third marriage was not a happy one, and he expressed sorrow in his diary when his wife joined him in Lombardy in 1480. After the death of Girolamo, relations with Caterina soured further and Nadi often slept in his shop with his employees. Nadi continued to quarrel with his stepchildren and in 1503, after selling the house, he moved in with his son Giovanni. The date of his death is recorded in the diary of a certain Tommaso di Gerardo Alessandrini, perhaps a fellow mason. Nadi was buried "with the great honour of the company of masons" (con grande onore de la conpagnia di moraduri) in the church of San Vitale in the place of his birth.

He was killed in a ballooning accident. Zambeccari was born in Bologna in 1756, son of Senator Giacomo Zambeccari. He studied at the Collegio dei nobili in Parma and then enlisted in the Guardia Real in Spain and served in the Spanish Navy. He fled from the Spanish Inquisition, and was in Paris in 1783 where he observed the first unmanned balloon flights by the Montgolfier brothers. He then moved to London and launched the first unmanned balloon in Britain on 4 November 1783, a year before the first manned flight in England by Vincent Lunardi, releasing a 5 feet (1.5 m) hydrogen balloon from the house of Michael Biaggini, a maker of artificial flowers made from silk and other fabrics, at 33 Noble Street, on Cheapside. The balloon was later found by a farmer at Waltham Abbey. The experiment was repeated a few weeks later, as a commercial enterprise for which Zambeccari and Biaggini sold tickets, with a release of a 10 feet (3.0 m) balloon from the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 25 November; this balloon was found nearly 40 miles (64 km) away at Petworth. Biaggini released an even larger 16 feet (4.9 m) balloon from Grosvenor Square in January 1784. Zambeccari was commissioned to launch a balloon in Venice in April 1784, an occasion that was painted by Francesco Guardi. He also collaborated with Vincent Lunardi before Lunardi's first manned flight in England on 15 September 1784. Zambeccari and Admiral Sir Edward Vernon ascended in a 34 feet (10 m) balloon from Tottenham Court Road on 23 March 1785 and landed later the same day near Horsham. The balloon was later displayed at the Lyceum. He also flew from Norwich later that year. Zambeccari moved to St Petersburg in 1787 and served in the Russian Imperial Navy. He was captured by the Turks in 1787 and held prisoner in Constantinople for over two years. His freedom was secured by the Spanish ambassador. He returned to Bologna, and married Diamante Negrini. They had three children, including Livio Zambeccari. He spent the rest of his life experimenting with balloons, generally using a combination of a hot air balloon and hydrogen balloon known as a rozière after Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier. He sought a method of steering using rudders or oars. He published a five-volume work on ballooning in London in 1803. He and his companions were rescued from the Adriatic Sea, twice, in 1803 and 1804. The government of Bologna, sponsored flight in 1803. Bad weather caused the flight to be postponed in September 1803. Wanting to avoid a second postponement, the balloon took off in bad weather on 7 October. Zambeccari was accompanied by Pasquale Andreoli and Gaetano Grassetti. In bad visibility, the balloon crashed into the Adriatic Sea early the following morning. Similarly, another flight with Andreoli on 23 August 1804 also crashed into the Adriatic Sea. Zambeccari died in September 1812, when his balloon caught fire after an unsuccessful landing attempt. His companion, Bonaga, survived. He was buried in the family tomb in the Basilica of San Francesco. His remains were moved to the Certosa di Bologna in 1813, but returned to San Francesco in 1926 to be interred with his son Livio in the monument to his relation Alessandro Zambeccari.

Allanbrook was born on March 15, 1943, in Hagerstown, Maryland. She attended Vassar College where she earned her undergraduate degree in classics. She earned a Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1974, where her doctoral dissertation became the basis for her 1983 book Rhythmic Gesture in Mozart: 'Le Nozze di Figaro' and 'Don Giovanni' published by the University of Chicago Press, in which she demonstrated that Mozart's music integrated references to the social practices and dances of his period. Forms of music used by Mozart would demonstrate information about characters in his operas. For example, a minuet would be characteristic of upper class status, while a gigue was representative of peasants. Her research influenced the way in which directors and conductors, including Roger Norrington and Peter Sellars, have staged Mozart's operas. In a review of works about Mozart on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the composer's death, music critic Edward Rothstein of The New York Times called Allanbrook's theories on the dances in The Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni to be among "the most intriguing insights into the music itself" that he had found. She served on the faculty of St. John's College in Maryland from 1969 to 1995, when she moved to the University of California, Berkeley, beginning her tenure there as a visiting professor. She was recognized as a Guggenheim Fellow in 1996. Cancer forced her to resign in 2003 as president of the American Musicological Society. Her book The Secular Commedia: Comic Mimesis in Late Eighteenth-Century Music was completed by her colleagues Mary Ann Smart and Richard Taruskin based on the content of her "Bloch lectures," delivered in fall 1994 at UC Berkeley, and was published in 2014 by the University of California Press. Allanbrook died of cancer at age 67 on July 15, 2010, at her home in Oakland, California. She was survived by a son. Her marriage to Douglas Allanbrook, a musician and composer who was a longtime professor at St. John's College, ended in divorce.

Gil-Robles received his master's degree in 1919 and in 1922 he gained by examination the chair of political law in the University of La Laguna (Tenerife). During the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera he was secretary of the Catholic-Agrarian National Confederation and member of the Writing Council of El Debate. After the declaration of the Second Spanish Republic, he participated in and led the Acción Nacional (National Action) party, later renamed Acción Popular (Popular Action). In the elections of 1931 he was chosen as a deputy in the Cortes for Salamanca. During the period of the Republic, he maintained the posture of "accidentalism": whether Spain was a monarchy or republic was less important than the law's compatibility with religious principles. Gil-Robles formed the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) which won the elections of November 1933. To avoid conflicts with leftist parties, President Niceto Alcalá-Zamora invested Alejandro Lerroux, leader of the Radicals, as prime minister instead of Gil Robles, the head of the largest party in the Cortes. The appointment of three CEDA ministers to the cabinet in 1934 triggered the leftist miners' strike that rose against the government of the Republic. Gil-Robles served as Minister of War under Lerroux from May to December 1935. In the decisive elections of February 1936, the CEDA was the largest part of the National Front coalition, which also included Alfonsine monarchists and Carlists. He campaigned for a majority under the slogan Todo el poder para el Jefe ("All the power to the Chief [i.e., Gil Robles]"), and while he himself was reelected to the Cortes, the National Front narrowly lost the elections. Gil-Robles is a unique and controversial figure in the history of Spanish politics. The nature of his political beliefs during the Second Republic either greatly fluctuated or were tailored to his audience, as he is recorded as making many statements that appear contradictory. This is certainly reflected in the nature of his party, the CEDA, which somehow managed to attract support from both moderate Catholic republicans and extreme right-wing monarchists. The controversy surrounding him has been best articulated by historians Paul Preston and Richard Robinson:  * Preston believes that Gil-Robles was essentially a legalist fascist, whose policy of accidentalism would give way to legislating for a fascist dictatorship when he was confident that the populace was controllable. His evidence references Gil Robles' speeches, which were often filled with "anti-democratic and anti-Semitic innuendo", the oppressive, anti-reformist nature of his government partnership with Alejandro Lerroux's Radicals, and the frank admiration offered to foreign fascist regimes by both his propaganda and by his press organ, El Debate.  * Robinson, however, rejects any claim that Gil-Robles was anything but a consummate politician struggling to keep the unstable right under control and within the law. The CEDA was not a mere front for fascist aspirations, but a party that was based on Catholic values, including a desire to pursue social Catholicism. Gil Robles himself certainly expressed pro-republican views; in an interview with the American journalist Mallory Browne he said, "I am the only friend of the Republic", and is recorded as declaring that "a new dictatorship would produce, after a period of tranquillity, social revolution." Following the victory of the Popular Front in the elections of February 1936 and the defeat of the CEDA, support for Gil-Robles and his party evaporated almost overnight. Most striking was the haemorrhaging of CEDA members to the explicitly fascist Falange. Bitterly disillusioned with the failure of their jefe, CEDA's youth group Juventudes de Acción Popular went over en masse to the Falange. In the following months and in the volatile situation that arose, Gil-Robles was well aware that a coup was being prepared. Despite his later insistence that he had no part in the destruction of the Republic, the CEDA leader was kept informed of each stage of the plot; members of his party played important liaison roles, facilitating contact between military and civilian plotters. Gil-Robles himself authorized the transfer of 500,000 pesetas of CEDA electoral funds to General Emilio Mola's military insurgents. Whatever his politics were, with the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, Gil-Robles was unwilling to struggle with Francisco Franco for power and in April 1937 announced the dissolution of CEDA. After the Civil War he went into exile. Abroad he negotiated with Spanish monarchists to try to arrive at a common strategy for taking power in Spain. In 1968 he was named a professor of the University of Oviedo and published his book No fue posible la paz ('Peace Was Not Possible'). He was a member of the International Tribunal at the Hague. After the death of Franco and the end of his regime, Gil-Robles became one of the leaders of the "Spanish Christian Democracy" party, which however got no support in the first post-Franco elections in 1977.

He was orphaned in 1812 around the age of seven. His father died in the War of 1812 and his mother soon after, leaving Albert to live with a sister in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. After working on a Mississippi keelboat in 1833, Albert went west in 1834 with a group of approximately sixty hunters to trap. He soon became part of the Western department of the American Fur Company at Fort Laramie. In 1836, he was sent to the South Platte area, where the weather trapped him for the winter on the Cache La Poudre. In the spring, he went to Fort William, later known as Bent's Fort, on the Arkansas River. From March to October 1838 he was employed at Fort Jackson by Peter Sarpy and Henry Fraeb. In 1847 he was employed at Simeon Turley's Mill about 12 miles from Taos at Arroyo Hondo. He was one of eight to ten mountain men who defended the mill in a siege by approximately 500 Mexicans and Indians during the Taos Revolt. Seeing the approaching mob, Charles Autobees rode to Santa Fe to get help. The remaining mountain men held off the attack into the night, when Albert and Autobees' half brother, Thomas Tate Tobin escaped separately on foot in the confusion of the fighting. Albert and Tobin were the only two men to escape Turley's Mill alive. In three days, Albert walked 140 miles to the trading post at Pueblo, through winter conditions with no coat, having escaped only with his weapons and shooting bag. Tobin walked to Santa Fe. Albert later settled in the Taos Valley, marrying the daughter of William Pope (Julia Pope). He carried mail out of the Spanish Peaks post office at Cuchara station, trapped on the Purgatory and Cuchara Rivers, and is credited with building the fort at La Plaza de la Leones.

Briefly a pupil of the Sienese draughtsman and cartographer Giuliano Periccioli, where he learned the art of engraving, Bernardino passed to the studio of the painter Rutilio Manetti and probably also served in the workshop of Francesco Rustici. He painted in and around Siena, where his work came to the attention of Cardinal Fabio Chigi, who, once elected pope as Alexander VII (1655), called Bernardino Mei to Rome in 1657. There Bernardino came under the influences of Mattia Preti, Andrea Sacchi and Pier Francesco Mola, and of Guercino, to the extent that until the 20th century Bernardino's fresco of Aurora in Palazzo Bianchi Bandinelli was attributed to Guercino himself. Through the fast friendship that bonded him to Gian Lorenzo Bernini, whose studio he frequented, he applied that sculptor's sense of theatrical action to his own mythological and allegorical subjects.

Gustav Naan was born in Russian SFSR in a village near Vladivostok to a family of Estonian settlers. He graduated from the Leningrad State University in 1941. He took part in World War II and joined the CPSU in 1943. Having settled to Estonia after the USSR annexed Estonia, Gustav Naan, a loyal communist and graduate of the Higher Party School of the AUCP(b) (1946). published a number of Stalinist-oriented polemic pieces (treating Estonian history and politics from the pro-Soviet perspective, e.g. “Eesti kodanlike natsionalistide ideoloogia reaktsiooniline olemus″ ('The Reactionary Essence of the Ideology of Estonian Bourgeois Nationalists'), 1947). In 1948, Naan published an article in Voprosy filosofii on the philosophical implications of the theory of relativity, criticizing 'physical idealists' of the US and Britain; in 1951, however, he published an article that decried vulgar materialist critics of the relativity theory whilst being ″tolerant on philosophic questions to a striking degree in Stalinist Russia, considering its place and time of publication″. Authors who followed Naan's article into discussion were almost universally critical of Naan's position. In 1952, which was the most intense year of the debate, three different authors published against Naan in the 1952 first issue of Voprosy filosofii alone. Naan was the director of the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR (1950–1951), Vice-President of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR (1951–1964). From 1964, Naan worked at the Institute of Astrophysics and Atmosphere Physics of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR. Having turned to theorizing on cosmology, cybernetics and demography, he often rejected taboos of both the 'traditional' world-view and orthodox communist opinions on such matters. He later claimed to have been one of the promoters of the theory of relativity at the time this was still considered pseudoscience by the Soviet authorities. He also proposed the Symmetric Universe hypothesis, according to which, side by side with the ordinary world, there is an anti-world. Naan was editor-in-chief of Eesti nõukogude entsüklopeedia (literally: Estonian Soviet Encyclopedia), the first edition of which started in the late 1960s. In terms of political affiliations, Naan remained a staunch supporter of the communist system and was a devote opponent of Estonia's pro-independence movement; Naan supported the (pro-Moscow) Internationalist Movement. Having gained much public support in the 1970s for his relatively bold opinion pieces on topics like family, morals and sex, he soon became a despised figure for his anti-independence stance, which was reflected in his newspaper articles of the time (e.g. his article «С ног на голову» ('From (standing on) Feet to (standing on) Head', Estonian title “Kõik pea peale″), condemning the Estonian Sovereignty Declaration passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR, was published in Pravda, 23.

Most of his fiction was in short story form, and usually featured a whimsical story line or ironic plot twist. He also wrote on military theory and public affairs, and edited some of the earliest books to consider SF from a literary theory and criticism perspective. Bretnor’s father, Grigory Kahn, was born in Russia, but he and his family left Siberia for Japan in 1917 and later settled in the United States. Bretnor’s mother was born a British subject, became a Russian subject, spent from 1917 to 1920 in Japan, then settled in the United States with her children Reginald and Margaret. Reginald Bretnor himself was born in Vladivostok, Russia. He was married to Helen Harding, a translator and U.C. Berkeley librarian, from 1948 until her death in 1967. He subsequently married Rosalie, whom he referred to in a letter in the Southern Oregon Historical Society Archives as Rosalie McShane, although she wrote under the name Rosalie Bodrero. According to papers in the SOHS Archives, Bretnor’s military background included service in the last cavalry unit in the U.S. Army. Health issues led to his discharge in August 1941. He tried to reenlist in 1942, but was rejected. He was hired by the Office of War Intelligence to write propaganda to be sent to Japan, and papers related to his work are held in the SOHS Archives. After World War II, Bretnor worked for the U.S. State Department until ill health once again caused him to resign. He died, aged 80, in Medford, Oregon. In addition to wars, weaponry and science fiction, Bretnor’s interests included cats. He translated Les Chats, the first known book about cats, written by Augustin Paradis de Moncrif in 1727. He also wrote multiple articles about cats, always owned cats, and considered himself to have a psychic connection to cats. It has been alleged that Bretnor was an early associate of Anton Szandor LaVey in the days before the founding of the Church of Satan, and that Bretnor and other science fiction authors were members of LaVey's "Order of the Trapezoid" in the early 1950s.

He is often confused with contemporary and fellow Dominican Tancred of Bologna, since the two of them are impossible to always distinguish in the sources. Tancred has been accredited many conversions and even miracles and by some accounts is beatified. Tancred was born in Siena to wealthy parents of the Tancredi clan. They oversaw his extensive education, sending him first to the University of Bologna and thence to Paris, where he received his doctorate. He returned from Paris to Siena, where he first heard the preaching of Dominic in the Sienese cathedral. According to later reports, he had a vision of the Virgin Mary standing beside Dominic and after the sermon she approached Tancred and beseeched him to "follow that man; and do not depart from him." In the Hospital of Saint Mary Magdalene Tancred received the habit from Dominic and embarked upon a life of religion. In an early incident related by Tancred to Jordan of Saxony, Dominic was visiting the prior's church when a young relative of Stephen Orsini, Cardinal Abbot of Fossanova, was carried past in a litter after falling from a horse. According to Jordan, it was unknown if he was alive or dead, but at the insistence of Tancred, Dominic prayed to God for the boys life and he was miraculously healed. This story was amplified by later retellings. The boy is Napoleon, Stephen's nephew, and Stephen faints upon hearing the news, falling into Dominic's arms. At Tancred's urging, it is Stephen who prays to God and receives a miracle: the boy, dead is brought back to life. Tancred was probably the prior of San Sisto Vecchio in Rome until it was converted into a Dominican nunnery. He was transferred to Santa Sabina to continue serving as prior. In 1222, after the death of Dominic the previous year, Tancred left Italy for the Holy Land as the superior of a group of friars, appointed by Jordan of Saxony to establish a mission there. Tancred founded several houses in the Latin East and it is claimed that he won many converts, to Christianity and to mendicancy. Though Tancred did not remain at the head of the Dominicans in the Holy Land, he did remain there until his death in 1241. The Dominican historian and hagiographer Gregory Lombardelli, wrote the first biography of Tancred, Vita de Tancredo Tancredi. He ascribes to him several works of as yet unpublished literature: commentaries on the Scriptures and on Peter Lombard's Book of Sentences. These were probably written during the period after his return to Siena and before his entrance into the order.

Born in Siena	Agostino Andrea Chigi (29 November 1466 – April 11, 1520) was an Italian banker and patron of the Renaissance. Born in Siena, he was the son of the prominent banker Mariano Chigi, a member of an ancient and illustrious house. He moved to Rome around 1487, collaborating with his father. The heir of a rich fund of capital, and enriched further after lending huge amounts of money to Pope Alexander VI (and to other rulers of the time as well), he strayed from common mercantile practice by obtaining lucrative monopolies like the salt monopoly of the Papal States and the Kingdom of Naples, as well as that of the alum excavated in Tolfa, Agnato and Ischia di Castro. Alum was an essential mordant in the textile industry. After the death of the Borgia pope Alexander VI and his short-lived Sienese successor Pius III Piccolomini, he helped Pope Julius II in the expenses attendant upon his election. The latter rewarded him, linking Chigi to the della Rovere family, and creating him treasurer and notary of the Apostolic Camera. The personal bond between the Pope and his banker remained close: Agostino accompanied Julius in the field in both his great military campaigns of 1506 and 1510. In 1511 Agostino was sent to Venice to buy Venetian support for the papal forces in the War of the League of Cambrai. Agostino established economic ties with the whole of Western Europe, at one time having up to 20,000 employees, receiving from Siena the title of Il Magnifico ("Magnificent"). Chigi, "indisputably the richest man in Rome", became also a rich patron of art and literature, the protector of Pietro Aretino among others, though his own education suffered many lacunae, notably his lack of Latin. His Venetian mistress Francesca Ordeaschi was the toast of Rome. His artistic protégés included almost all the main figures of the early 16th century: Perugino, Sebastiano del Piombo, Giovanni da Udine, Giulio Romano, Sodoma and Raphael. In Rome, Chigi's three artistic commissions involving Raphael remain the most prominent monuments of his contemporary fame: a chapel in Santa Maria della Pace; his mortuary chapel, the Chigi Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo; and the suburban villa known since 1579 as the Villa Farnesina, all of them intended to give substance to his legend. His splendid villa that he built on the shore of the Tiber, in Trastevere, bears the name of its later owners: Villa Farnesina (illustration). For its design, Chigi employed the Sienese painter Baldassare Peruzzi, virtually untried as an architect. Sebastiano del Piombo, Giovanni da Udine, Giulio Romano, Sodoma and Raphael were called upon to provide the decoration. Here Raphael frescoed his Triumph of Galatea. Here Chigi held sumptuous repasts. In order to show his contempt of money, he was said to have all the silver dishes thrown into the river after the end of the parties; however, his servants were secretly ready to recollect them with nets draped under the windows. The villa called the Viridario in Chigi's time served as banking facility as well as residence, setting Chigi apart from the ordinary run of bankers in Rome, who normally resided in a piano nobile directly above but unconnected to their street-level botteghe.

Born in Siena	Alessandro Safina (born October 14, 1963) is an Italian operatic tenor. Born in Siena, Italy, Safina's love of opera was encouraged early in life by his mother encouraged his eagerness. His father was also a singer. The early 21st century saw the rise of this Italian singer who has combined his opera roots with modern-day pop music. Late in his teens, Safina began to appreciate pop and rock music, drawing inspiration from such bands as Genesis, The Clash, Simple Minds, and U2. Shortly thereafter, he began to combine the opera and pop genres. In the '90s, Safina was discovered by renowned Italian pianist/composer Romano Musumarra and the pair quickly began to record together, in an attempt to bring Safina's dream of creating a "soulful new pop opera music" to fruition. The result was Safina's self-titled debut, issued in September 2001. It contained a single named "Luna", released in 1999, which reached number 2 in the Dutch charts. The song is mainly about finding a long lost love. In 2001, Safina contributed to the score of Baz Luhrmann’s film Moulin Rouge!. He performed Elton John's Your Song with Ewan McGregor. In September 2001, his concert Only You was taped in the amphitheatre El Greco in Taormina, Sicily. The concert was later broadcast in the series Great Performances by American public channel PBS and released in 2003 on DVD. In 2003, Safina performed the English and Korean vocals for a Korean song called Hamangyeon (하망연(何茫然)), which was featured as part of the soundtrack for Dae Jang Geum, a popular South Korean historical drama TV series. Safina appeared in a film Tosca e Altre Due, based on the opera Tosca of Puccini. In 2007, he recorded a duet with the British Soprano Sarah Brightman for her album, "Symphony". He was then invited to join her during her "Symphony World Tour" for Mexico's presentations in November 2008 and in the Asian Tour in March-April 2009.

His writings on contemporary artists like Caravaggio and Annibale Carracci remain one of our earliest sources of biographical information; his Considerazioni being an important source on art in early 17th-century Rome. Mancini was born in Siena and attended the University of Padua, where he studied medicine, astrology and philosophy. He went to Rome in 1592, where he practised medicine; from 1595 at the Hospital of Santo Spirito. He became personal physician to pope Urban VIII in 1623. The pope was a notable patron of the arts, and their relationship was such that, in 1628, Mancini was made an apostolic protonotary and a canon of St. Peter's. Mancini's writings went unpublished until the 20th century; his Considerazioni sulla pittura (thoughts on painting), written between 1617 and 1621, remaining so until 1956. His advice to the collector gives us insight into the contemporary art market in Rome; his notes on spotting fakes were the first indication of how sophisticated these pastiches had already become by the early 17th century. In the Considerazioni, he distinguishes four tracts of painting in his contemporary Rome: that of Caravaggio; that of Carracci; the third of Giuseppe Cesari; and the fourth of everybody else, the mannerist painter Cristoforo Roncalli for instance. There is evidence that he knew, at least Caravaggio, well, having attended to the artist when he was ill and staying at the Palazzo Madama, probably in 1595. Mancini was also well acquainted with Caravaggio's benefactor, Francesco Maria del Monte. As dealer he most notably sold Caravaggio's The Death of the Virgin to Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua for 280 scudi in 1607; a transaction proposed to the Duke by Peter Paul Rubens and brokered by Giovanni Magno. In his private life, Mancini was known as a self-confessed atheist, someone who moved in libertine circles, an art lover and a connoisseur. He was a member of the Accademia degli Umoristi, a literary club founded in 1603, which members included Giovanni Battista Guarini, Alessandro Tassoni, and Gian Vittorio Rossi. He also wrote on such diverse subjects as dancing and the ways of courtiers. Upon his death, Mancini left his fortune to be distributed among the students of Siena.

Maitani established his reputation in Siena and was called to supervise the construction at Orvieto in 1308 when the unprecedented height and span of the cathedral's vaults and arches presented unforeseen difficulties. In 1310 he received the title capomaestro of the cathedral and became, in addition, overseer of bridges and civic buildings. The design of the cathedral's façade is considered to be Maitani's most important work. Though his contributions to the façade as a sculptor are difficult to determine, it may be assumed that his sensibility dictated the overall scheme. Two of the panels attributed to Maitani, "Scenes from Genesis" and "The Last Judgment," are delicate bas-reliefs unified by an ascending vine that suggests a French Gothic influence. Sculptures generally attributed to Maitani include the bronze "Eagle of St. John" and the "Angel of St. Matthew."

He was born Piero di Giovanni in Siena. Little is known about his youth, apart from the fact that he was apprenticed in Florence. He was influenced by Giotto and his followers Spinello Aretino and Agnolo Gaddi. In 1390 he joined the Camaldolese monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli. He was thenceforth generally known as Lorenzo Monaco (English: "Lawrence the Monk"). In the 1390s he executed three panels of the Biblioteca Laurenziana for his convent. Starting from around 1404 his works show the influence of the International Gothic, of Lorenzo Ghiberti's earliest works and of Gherardo Starnina. From this period is the Pietà in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Florence. His works, often over a gilded background, showed in general a spiritual value, and usually did not feature profane elements. In 1414 he painted the Coronation of the Virgin (now at the Uffizi), characterized by a great number of saints and brilliant colors. In the late part of his life, Lorenzo did not accept the early Renaissance innovations introduced by artists such as Masaccio and Brunelleschi. This is visible in the Adoration of the Magi of 1420–1422, where the now widespread geometrical perspective is totally absent. Lorenzo's works remained popular in the 1420s, as testified by the numerous commissions he received, such as the Stories of the Virgin in the Bartolini Salimbeni Chapel of Santa Trinita, one of his few frescoes. Giorgio Vasari includes a biography of Lorenzo Monaco in his Lives. According to the Florentine historian, he died from an unidentified infection, perhaps gangrene or a tumour.

During his lifetime he published two minor poems, "La niñez Laureada" (dealing with an infant prodigy, who at the age of hardly four years underwent a university examination), and "La Teclogia". Before producing these he had composed his really important poems, which are chiefly satirical and epigrammatical in their nature. In fact, as a satirist he is to be ranked only lower than Francisco de Quevedo. Certain portions of his satirical lyrics provided offense to the authorities, and the 1798 edition of them was put on the Index by the Inquisition. The necessity of this action was denied by some of his warm friends. Among the better-known editions of his works are those of Barcelona (1820 and 1837), of Paris (1821), and of Madrid (1841). They are most readily accessible in the "Biblioteca de autores Españoles", vol. LXI, which contains about 38 letrillas—in the composition of which he excelled—besides a numbers of satires, epigrams, odes, anacreontics, ecologues, etc. Not long since, some of his unedited poems were published by R.

He worked in the style established by earlier Sienese painters Duccio, Simone Martini, Pietro Lorenzetti and Ambrogio Lorenzetti. More than 50 works have been attributed to him. This large output contributed to the long-term survival of the decorative Sienese style well into the 15th century.

He generally has been identified as Niccolò di Ser Sozzo di Francesco Tegliacci, but recent research points instead to a Niccolò di Ser Sozzo di Stefano. Whatever his true identity, Niccolo was one of the leading panel painters and miniaturists at work in Siena in the mid-14th century. His style is closest to that of Lippo Vanni and his sometime collaborator Luca di Tomme and is ultimately dependent upon the tradition of Simone Martini and, especially, the Lorenzetti brothers, in whose workshop he may have apprenticed. His most celebrated and earliest documented work is an elaborate Assumption of the Virgin forming the frontispiece to the Sienese land and property registration book known as the Codex Caleffo (c. 1334), now found in the Archivio di Stato at Siena. This work is inscribed in Latin "Nicholaus, Ser Sozzi de Senis me pinxit" (Niccolo di Sozzo of Siena painted me). Among the several paintings attributed to his hand is a dismembered polyptych in the Pinacoteca Civica of San Gimignano, formerly in the nearby church of Monteoliveto, also featuring an "Assumption". Also near to San Gimignano in the town of Poggibonsi, the church of San Antonio once held a "Virgin and Child" that is now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence and a "Madonna and Child with Two Angels and Two Saints" is in Siena's Pinacoteca. The Getty Museum in Los Angeles possesses a fragment of one of his largest works, depicting "Virgin and Child with Two Angels". Another of Niccolò's panels representing the Virgin and Child against a cloth of honor is in a private Milanese collection. Niccolò is best known, however, as a miniaturist. In addition to his "Assumption" from the "Callefo" in the Siena Archives, that city's library contains an antiphonary with four illuminations by Niccolò (Virgin and Child, Presentation, Baptism, Resurrection of the Dead). The Museo di Arte Sacra in San Gimignano preserves a choirbook (Graduale LXVIII) with a number of historiated initials attributed to Niccolò (Adoration the Magi, Presentation Pentecost, Trinity, Assumption of the Virgin, San Gimignano adored by five monks, San Gimignano Enthroned). The Cini Foundation in Venice has a fine cutting with the Annunciation. Miniatures by Niccolò di Ser Sozzo are to be found in American collections as well. Among these are an initial on an antiphonary page in the Newark Museum showing yet another Assumption, a cutting from a choirbook depicting two female saints in the Cleveland Museum of Art, an Ascension in the Initial V excised from an antiphonary now in New York's Metropolitan Museum, a Resurrection on a gradual page (Plimpton MS040F) in Columbia University's Rare Book and Manuscript Library, eleven initials (four historiated and seven flourished) on the pages of an antiphonal from the Joline Collection now in the Barnard College Library of Columbia University. The four historiated Joline initials depict the Consecration of the Host, the "Stigmata of St. Francis Observed by Brother Leo", the Death of St. Francis, and St. Anthony holding a book. The Rare Book Department of the Free Library of Philadelphia has a cutting of the Trinity (Lewis EM 025:05) which it dates to 1345–50 and a page from a gradual with an initial with Christ as the Man of Sorrows (Lewis EM 069:09). A cutting with St. John the Baptist in the Michigan Museum of Art might also come from Niccolò's hand. Pages from a missal in Columbia, South Carolina, feature two historiated initials with the "Massacre of the Innocents" and an "Angel Appearing to St. Joseph".

He practiced medicine in Ypres and Paris, and in 1697 moved to Ghent, where he remained for the rest of his career. Palfijn is remembered for introducing the obstetrical forceps (Main de Palfijn) into medicine in the early 1720s. Palfijn's forceps initially had a problem because the two separate halves occasionally shifted during use. Later the two halves of the forceps were linked by a hinge to correct the problem. In 1718 Palfijn published an influential work for surgeons called l'Anatomie du corps humain (Anatomy of the human body). Reportedly, this book was still in use in Japan in the latter part of the 19th century. Today in Ghent there are the Palfijn Medical Museum and the Jan Palfijn Hospital.

Nikolayev reached his position as mayor when his opponent for the position "tripped" on a grenade left outside his office, killing him. The city court of Vladivostok removed Nikolayev from his post as the city's mayor in March 2007. Immediately after the decision was made, Nikolayev gave a press conference, in which he called the case against him a "sheer falsification" and "someone’s paid order". In a press statement, the prosecutor's office of Russian federal subject Primorsky Krai announced, "Vladimir Nikolayev called the criminal case initiated against him by prosecutors as a paid and ordered deal and his speech was broadcast by all local and many federal news agencies. In this respect Primorye’s prosecutor’s office asks the General prosecutor’s office to make a legal assessment of Nikolayev’s remarks concerning the case against him." Originally, Primorsky Krai launched a criminal investigation against Nikolayev and charged him with embezzlement. It also appealed to the city court, requesting that Nikolayev's duties as city mayor be halted while the investigation was ongoing. Soon after, the city court temporarily dismissed Nikolayev from his office, stating, "Nikolayev should not have the power to influence his subordinates during an investigation carried out against him."

His father, Nori Nono'oohimae, was one of the founders of the Maasina Ruru movement of civil disobedience against British colonial rule, in the 1940s. A barrister by profession, Andrew Nori was "one of the first Solomon Islanders to qualify as a lawyer", and eventually became president of the Solomon Islands bar association. He began his political career when he was elected to the National Parliament in the 1984 general election, as MP for the West 'Are'are constituency. Prime Minister Sir Peter Kenilorea appointed him Minister for Home Affairs and Provincial Government, a position which he held for four years. He was re-elected in 1989, and, as head of the Nationalist Front for Progress, was for a time appointed Leader of the Official Opposition to Prime Minister Solomon Mamaloni's government. Re-elected to Parliament for a third term in 1993, he was appointed Minister for Finance in Prime Minister Francis Billy Hilly's government. In September 1994, he resigned in the face of reports that over A$70,000 had been transferred to his personal bank account from "an unnamed overseas source". He stated that he had "listed the amount with the relevant leadership code commission", but was stepping down "until his name was cleared". He did not regain his Cabinet position, and was defeated in his bid to retain his Parliament seat in the 1997 general election. This marked the end of his career in national politics.

On 5 June 2000, he led the Eagle Force into a coup d'état against Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, taking him hostage at gunpoint and demanding that he resign.

Nori accused Ulufa'alu of not having prevented an escalation in the ethnic conflicts on Guadalcanal. The Eagle Force was temporarily described as "in control" of the capital city, Honiara. Nori told the Australian media he had led the coup because there was "a need for an immediate change in leadership and for the issues relating to peace to be focussed on more seriously and for a more efficient method and mechanism to be established to attend to peace issues and on the negotiation between the warring parties on Guadalcanal". The coup rapidly led to the arrival of a Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group delegation, which was welcomed by Nori, who expressed his hope that it would result in peace being brokered between the ethnic factions. Parliament voted to elect Manasseh Sogavare to the premiership, replacing Ulufa'alu, and the ethnic conflicts ceased for the most part with the Townsville Peace Agreement in October. In September 2000, the Pacific Media Watch accused Nori of having threatened journalist Duran Angiki and his family over an allegedly incorrect report published by the latter on Nori. In 2009, still practicing as a lawyer, Nori made headlines again by publicly criticising the Political Parties Registration and Administration Bill, saying it would entrench rather than resolve political instability in the country. As of early 2011, he was working as a consultant to the Customary Land Reform Unit, researching rules of customary land ownership throughout the country with an aim towards a government policy "to codify customary land laws and have them elevated to statutory status". In 2012, he was elected President of the National Olympic Committee of Solomon Islands. He died in hospital in Honiara on 9 July 2013, "after a long illness". In its obituary, the newspaper Solomon Star praised him as a "great leader" and one of the "greatest figures" in the country's history. Andrew Nori's wife, Delmah Nori, founded the Twelve Pillars to Peace and Prosperity Party in 2010. She is also the former president of the Solomon Islands Netball Association.

At his return, he became a Professor of the resistance of materials at the school of architecture of the Universidad de Chile, while continuing his work at the State Railroads, where he designed several railroad bridges (such as the Claro, near Yumbel, the Perquilauquén near Quella, and the viaduct of Las Cucharas in the Santiago-Valparaíso track.) In 1911 he became Dean of Mathematics at the university, and in 1917, also became director of the schools of engineering and architecture. In 1918, Trucco resigned all his positions at the university in order to dedicate himself to his work as General Director of Railroads, a position he held until 1924. Trucco joined the Radical Party and in 1926 became its president, but resigned shortly afterwards due to his poor health. The same year he was elected Senator for "Arauco, Malleco and Cautín" (1926-1930). After the resignation of president Carlos Ibáñez del Campo in 1931, his successor, vice-President Juan Esteban Montero named Trucco as Minister of the Interior on August 7, 1931. Very soon after, Montero accepted the presidential nomination for the upcoming elections. Since Montero was constitutionally banned from standing as a candidate while still in office, as a way out of the political impasse, and in order to qualify, he resigned his vice-presidency effective on August 20, 1931. The position was assumed by Manuel Trucco as Vice President. The Trucco administration was only a caretaker one, charged with keeping order in the country until after the presidential elections. Nonetheless it was faced with very difficult moments such as the Sailors' mutiny in the navy, caused by the reduction of the salaries of the enlisted men (September 1–5, 1931), which was controlled only after an aerial bombing of the fleet, but which predicted difficult times ahead. He remained as Vice President until November 15, when Juan Esteban Montero resumed power after sweeping the election. President Arturo Alessandri named him ambassador to the United States between 1932 and 1938. At his return, Trucco retired from politics, but in 1946, PresidentGabriel González Videla appointed him Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, a position he held until 1951. Manuel Trucco died in Santiago in 1954 at the age of 79.

Antonio Varas was born in Cauquenes, the son of Miguel Varas Vallejo and of Agustina de la Barra Alarcón.

León Toral was born in Matehuala, San Luis Potosí, into a family of Catholic miners. He moved to Mexico City during the Mexican Revolution and witnessed the then-Constitutionalist general Obregón closing churches and arresting priests who were suspected of supporting former president Victoriano Huerta. In 1920, he joined the National League for the Defense of Religious Freedom, which opposed the governments of Obregón (1920–1924) and Plutarco Elías Calles and reportedly was also involved in the Cristero movement. During the Calles administration, oppression against the Catholic Church greatly expanded in 1926 under the Calles Law, which provided severe penalties for priests and individuals who violated the provisions of the 1917 Constitution. For instance, wearing clerical garb in public (outside Church buildings) earned a fine of 500 pesos (approximately $250 US at the time); a priest who criticized the government could be imprisoned for five years, with no right to trial by jury. Some states enacted even more oppressive measures. Chihuahua enacted a law permitting only a single priest to serve the entire Catholic congregation of the state. To help enforce the law, Calles seized church property, expelled all foreign priests, and closed the monasteries, convents and religious schools. Obregón had been more lenient to Catholics during his time in office, but the Cristeros and almost everyone else believed that Calles was his puppet leader. In 1927, two of León Toral's friends Humberto and Miguel Pro were executed after having been wrongly convicted of plotting to assassinate Obregón. Thus, having been incited by a Catholic nun, Concepción Acevedo de la Llata (also known as Madre Conchita), he decided to assassinate Obregón, whom he blamed for the Mexican government's atrocities against the Catholic Church, if Obregón was reelected. On 17 July 1928, two weeks after Obregón had been re-elected president, León Toral entered disguised as a caricaturist to La Bombilla, a restaurant in San Ángel, during a banquet organized to honor General Obregón. He made a caricature of Obregón and Aarón Sáenz and showed it to Obregón, who told him the drawing had good likeness and suggested he continue. After Obregón turned around to sit down, León Toral suddenly drew a gun and shot him five or six times in the back, killing Obregón instantly. León Toral was arrested immediately and pleaded guilty, claiming he killed Obregón in order to facilitate the establishment of the Kingdom of Christ. Mother Conchita was also arrested and received a 20-year prison sentence but was pardoned after serving 13 and eventually married Carlos Castro Balda, a bomber of the Mexican Chamber of Deputies. León Toral was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in February 1929. His last words were ¡Viva Cristo Rey! (Long Live Christ the King!), the battle cry of the Cristeros.

Bunchhoeun composed more than 200 songs between the 1960s and the 1970s and contributed to “Golden Age” of films and songs in Cambodia. He composed a number of hit songs for Cambodia's greatest singer of all time, Sinn Sisamouth and the contemporary vocalist and singer Preap Sovath. Most of his work touched upon his hometown of Battambang, earning him the pen name “Master Poet of Sangkae River”. Bunchhoeun composed a number of poems and novels when Cambodian literature flourished in the 1960s, and he survived the Khmer regime partly as he wrote less towards the fall of Phnom Penh to the Khmer Rouge. Currently, there is no real reliable record as to how many novels and songs he might have written. Bunchhoeun’s most well-known work of literature, The Fate of Tat Marina, published in 2000, is a loosely fictionalised account of his niece Tat Marina’s affair with Svay Sitha, an undersecretary of state at the Council of Ministers, and the subsequent acid attack that left her suffering ghastly wounds. Marina identified Sitha’s wife, Khourn Sophal, as her attacker. An arrest warrant for Sophal was signed, but she was never arrested. As Bunchhoeun saw Marina’s story as an opportunity to speak out, he received death threats, fled to Thailand after 2000, and later sought an asylum in Norway in 2005. Bunchhoeun continued writing in self-exile, publishing at least 10 books from abroad.

Koide is famous for his eponymous Koide formula, which some physicists think has great importance while other physicists contend that the formula is merely a numerical coincidence. Koide earned in 1967 a B.Sc. with major in physics and in 1967 a M.Sc. in Theoretical Elementary Particle Physics from Kanazawa University. In 1970, he received his Doctor of Science degree from Hiroshima University with a thesis “On the Two-Body Bound State Problem of Dirac Particles”. After working as a postdoc in the physics department of Hiroshima University and then a postdoc in the applied mathematics department of Osaka University, he became, from 1972 to 1973, a Lecturer in the School of Science and Engineering, Kinki University, Osaka. Koide was Assistant Professor (1973-1977) then Associate Professor (1977-1987) of General Education, Shizuoka Women's University, Shizuoka. From April 1987 to March 2007 he was a Professor of Physics at University of Shizuoka, Shizuoka and then retired as professor emeritus. In 1986 he was a visiting professor at the University of Maryland and in 2002 a visiting researcher at CERN. Koide was from April 2007 to March 2009, a guest professor at Research Institute for Higher Education and Practice, Osaka University, then from April 2009 to March 2011 a guest professor and from April 2011 a guest researcher at Osaka University, and from April 2010 a professor, Department of Maskawa Institute, Kyoto Sangyo University, Kyoto. In the composite model of mesons, Koide's thesis demonstrated that a mass of a composite particle which consists of the rest masses cannot be lighter than except for the case when JP is not = 0-. This offered a severe problem for the quark model. (Koide’s work was done before the establishment of QCD.) Katuya and Koide predicted that lifetimes of D± and D0 should be considerably different from what was at that time the conventional anticipation tau(D±)= tau(D0). Their prediction of these lifetimes was the first in the world prior to the experimental observation. He published the famous Koide formula in 1982 with a different presentation in 1983. Originally, Koide's proposed charged lepton mass formula was based on a composite model of quarks and leptons. In a 1990 paper, from the standpoint that the charged leptons are elementary, by introducing a scalar boson with (octet + singlet) of a family symmetry U(3), Koide re-derived the charged lepton mass formula from minimizing conditions for the scalar potential. In 2009, he related the neutrino mixing matrix to the up-quark mass matrix.

While still a student, he set a new unofficial world record for the triple jump, and was widely expected to secure the gold medal in the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. However, Ōshima suffered from severe burns in a bathing accident shortly before the start of the Olympics, and was not in the best form for the competition. He finished third with a jump of 15.12 meters behind the teammate Chuhei Nambu who took gold. Ōshima also participated in the same event in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, but came in sixth place, while teammates Naoto Tajima and Masao Harada took the gold and silver medals, respectively.

As commander of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, commonly referred to as the Makhnovshchina, Makhno led a guerrilla campaign during the civil war. Makhno fought all factions which sought to impose any external authority over southern Ukraine, battling in succession the Ukrainian Nationalists, the Imperial German and Austro-German occupation, the Hetmanate Republic, the White Army, the Red Army, and other smaller forces led by Ukrainian otamans. Makhno and his movement repeatedly attempted to reorganize life in the Huliaipole region along anarchist-communist lines; however, the disruptions of the civil war precluded any long-term social experiments. Although Makhno considered the Bolsheviks a threat to the development of an anarchist Free Territory within Ukraine, he twice entered into military alliances with them to defeat the White Army. In the aftermath of the defeat of the White Army in the region in November 1920, the Bolsheviks initiated a military campaign against Makhno, which concluded with his escape across the Romanian border in August 1921. After a series of imprisonments and escapes, Makhno finally settled in Paris with his wife Halyna and daughter Yelena. In exile Makhno wrote three volumes of memoirs. Makhno died in exile at the age of 45 from tuberculosis-related causes. He is also credited as the inventor of the tachanka, a horse-drawn platform mounting a heavy machine gun.

He knew more than 20 languages. Many literary works were successfully translated from the majority of these languages and introduced to the Ukrainian literature by him. The literary prize Ars Translationis has been instituted by "Vsesvit" since 1989 to commemorate Lukash. Lukash was born into a family of teachers. From childhood he picked up foreign languages with ease. He began studying at the History Faculty of the Kyiv State University, but his studies were interrupted by the Second World War. He fought in the Soviet Army from 1943. In 1947 after graduating from the Institute of Foreign Languages in Kharkiv, Lukash worked as a teacher of foreign languages. He then became head of the Department of Poetry for the journal “Vsesvit” [“Universe”]. Lukash was blessed with phenomenal linguistic talents and had an extraordinarily wide knowledge of foreign literature. He is considered to have been one of the most outstanding Ukrainian translators, translating literary works from 20 languages. He was also one of the figures who created an alternative Ukrainian culture. He was most prolific during the relatively favourable twenty-year period between 1953 and 1973, when he translated Goethe’s “Faust”, Flaubert’s “Madame Bovary”, the poetry of Schiller, Bocaccio’s “Decameron” and many other works. He was a member of the Union of Writers of Ukraine from 1956 and played an active role in Ukrainian literary life. Lukash always gave moral support to writers who were being oppressed. Then after the arrest of I. DZIUBA, whom Lukash considered to be the most outstanding figure in Ukrainian culture, he sent a letter to the Head of the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR, the Head of the Ukrainian Supreme Court and the General Prosecutor of the Ukrainian SSR with a copy to the Presidium of the Administration of the Union of Writers of Ukraine, in which he disagreed with the court ruling, calling it unjust, protested against the expulsion of I.DZIUBA from the Union of Writers of Ukraine (UWU) and offered as a person living alone to serve the sentence instead of I.DZIUBA who was a family man and in bad health: “I humbly ask that you allow me to serve the period of imprisonment in his place...” This act cost Lukash dear. He was dismissed from the editorial board of the journal “Vsesvit” and told that he would be forcibly treated in a special psychiatric hospital. Fortunately these threats were not carried out. On 12 June 1973 the Presidium of the Administration of the UWU voted unanimously to expel Lukash from the Union. While discussing his personal case, Lukash stated that during the previous years he had been terrorised, not allowed to work normally, that he, indeed, disagreed with the ruling of the court in I. DZIUBA’s case, that everybody had pushed him to retract his criticism but that he considered that even if he were to withdraw “my groan of pain”, nobody would believe him in any case. For many years he was effectively under house arrest. He was persecuted in all possible ways and his works stopped being published, depriving him of means of existence. For a long time there was a police officer permanently stationed at the entry to his block who didn’t allow anyone to visit him. Lukash was reinstated in the UWU on the wave of perestroika in 1987, when he was almost a dying man. In 1988 he became Laureate of the Maxim Rylsky Republic Award. Within a few months, on 29 August 1988, Mykola Lukash died. He did not live to see the publication of a large volume of his translations which came out under the title “From Bocaccio to Apollinaire” in 1990 and became a kind of monument to Lukash. The compiler of the volume, M. Moskalenko states that “in Mykola Lukash Ukraine was sent a Mozartian genius in the truest and most exact meaning of this word”.'''''“People like Lukash are probably born once in several centuries” is how the prominent Ukrainian translator H. Kochur described him.

Lorentz was born in Kahla, Thuringia. He initially studied theology at the Universities of Jena and Erlangen. From 1858 he studied botany at the University of Munich, where he was a pupil of Carl Wilhelm von Nägeli. He focused his attention towards the study of mosses, subsequently collecting specimens throughout Europe (the Black Forest, the Austrian Alps, Switzerland, northern Italy and Scandinavia). With Wilhelm Philippe Schimper, he collaborated on Geographie der Moose. In 1870 he emigrated to Argentina, where he was appointed professor of botany at the University of Córdoba. In 1871–72, he explored the mountainous regions of Tucumán and Catamarca provinces with geologist Alfred Wilhelm Stelzner (1840–1895). Bryological specimens found on the expedition were kept for personal study by Lorentz, while vascular plants that he collected were sent to August Grisebach for further analysis, who described the vascular specimens in the treatise "Plantae Lorentzianae" (1874). With his assistant, Georg Hieronymous, he conducted botanical investigations through the northern provinces of Jujuy and Salta, and into the lowlands of the Gran Chaco and Bolivia. Collections from this expedition were described by Grisebach (along with Lorentz's later collections from Entre Rios Province) in the treatise "Symbolae ad Floram Argentinam" (1879). His collection of lichens from the expedition were shipped to August von Krempelhuber and his Hepaticae specimens were sent to bryologist Karl Müller. In 1874, due to political events, he relocated to Concepción del Uruguay as an instructor of natural history. In 1879, with Gustavo Niederlein (1858–1924), he participated in a scientific expedition across the Pampas to the Rio Negro. Lorentz died in Concepción del Uruguay at the age of 46 on 6 October 1881, a victim of liver disease. As a result of his Argentine excursions, he collected many species of flowering plants, mosses and lichens that were new to science. Also, he is credited with providing the first phytogeographical map of Argentina.

Archaeologist Arthur Evans had discovered Linear B in 1900 during his excavations at Knossos on the Greek island of Crete who spent decades trying to comprehend its writings until his death in 1941. Bennett and Alice Kober cataloged the 80 symbols used in the script in his 1951 work The Pylos Tablets, which provided linguist John Chadwick and amateur scholar Michael Ventris with the vital clues needed to finally decipher Linear B in 1952. Bennett was born on July 12, 1918, in Minneapolis and attended the University of Cincinnati, where he studied the classics, earning bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees, and was a student of the American archaeologist Carl Blegen, who had uncovered a series of tablets inscribed in Linear B during excavations he had conducted at Pylos in 1939. Bennett worked as a cryptanalyst on the American effort decoding Japanese ciphers during World War II, despite not knowing any Japanese. After beginning his academic career at Yale University and the University of Texas, Bennett spent almost three decades on the faculty of the University of Wisconsin–Madison before he retired in 1988. Bennett's papers were acquired and have been cataloged and organized by the Program in Aegean Scripts and Prehistory at the University of Texas. Bennett was awarded the Gold Medal of the Archaeological Institute of America in 2001 in recognition of "outstanding contributions to the field of archaeology" for his role in cataloging Linear B texts and the development of the field of Mycenaean studies. Bennett died in Madison, Wisconsin at the age of 93. He was survived by two daughters, three sons and four grandchildren.

He attended the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, earning his BFA degree in 1993. He is represented by Zieher Smith & Horton, in New York City. Spangler's sculptures typically consist of carved solid blocks of basswood that are finished with coats of black gesso and graphite. Spangler carves his sculptures using mallets, chisels, and a Dremel-style rotary tool. Ken Johnson commented that, ""You don't see much wood carving in elite Chelsea galleries. An antiquated craft with little relevance to modern technologies of communication or to a competitive, fast-paced contemporary art market...so it is exciting to come upon the large, intricate reliefs". Spangler works three-dimensionally and in bas-relief, a challenging and intricate medium. His work is often concerned with "war's devastation and its potential as a metaphor for psychological conflict" as well as "anarchy in rural America". His sculptures seek to envision a "fascinating and frightening revolution against passive consumerism 'of the people, by the people'" Multi-faceted, his work reveals more upon second and third glances; shifting scale and perspective propelling the viewer deeper into the psyche of the piece, leading one critic to claim that Spangler piled "images and motifs, just like ancient Romans heaped up captured armor and weapons as trophies". Spangler has transformed "a marginalized craft typically associated with bearded, plaid-shirted gentlemen of a certain age into a conduit for the mythology of the Midwest without diminishing its tactility or symbolic richness".

An Olympian in 1968, he won long-distance track doubles at both the 1967 World Student Games and the 1967 Pan American Games. Born in Minneapolis, Nelson attended Washburn High School and began competing in middle distance events there. He broke the school record for the mile run and was ranked fifth nationally as a high school runner in 1964. He graduated that year (later being inducted into the school's hall of fame) and went on to study at St. Cloud State University. He competed collegiately for the St. Cloud State Huskies in NAIA competitions. He was the team's captain in both track and field and cross country and won seven titles and 12 All-American honours during his four years representing the institution. He was inducted into the St. Cloud Hall of Fame in 1983, featuring in the second group of athletes to be given the honour. At the Drake Relays, he won both the three-mile and six-mile races three times consecutively from 1966 to 1968. The 1967 season was the peak of Nelson's career. He won the Amateur Athletic Union six-mile title then completed a 5000 meters/10,000 meters track double at the 1967 World Student Games. He repeated this feat at the 1967 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, becoming the second man to complete the long-distance double after Argentina's Osvaldo Suárez. Nelson made his Olympic debut in the 10,000 m at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. He was not used to the hot conditions or altitude and his performance suffered as a result. In spite of being ranked eighth in the world for that event, he finished in 29th place with a time of 31:40.2 minutes. Although, he had not performed well, he was pleased to have represented his country at the competition. Nelson returned to his studies at St. Cloud State in 1969, but the year after he suffered a serious back injury due to heavy lifting and the surgery that followed impaired his running ability. He made his last international appearance in 1971 and retired thereafter, although he continued running for pleasure. Nelson has retired from his job as a health teacher, although he still substitute teaches. He still serves as a girls track and field coach at South View Middle School in Edina, Minnesota.

Known for his defense and bunting, he won several Gold Gloves, made two All-Star teams and set several sacrifice hit records. Kawai was a pitcher in high school. In 1982, the Giants took him in the first round of the draft. He was moved to the infield and debuted for the Giants in 1984, mostly as a defensive substitute and pinch-hitter, getting only 126 plate appearances over 159 games in his first four years. He got 81 plate appearances at age 23 in 1988, hitting .268/.307/.423. Masahiro became a regular for the 1989 Giants, batting .254/.312/.361 and won his first Gold Glove as the top defensive shortstop in the Central League. He hit .190/.261/.238 for Yomiuri as they won the 1989 Japan Series. The next season, he set a new Nippon Professional Baseball record with 58 sacrifice hits and put up a good .288/.356/.450 line with career highs in slugging, home runs (9) and steals (9). He made the first of his two All-Star appearances and won another Gold Glove. In the 1990 Japan Series, he went 2 for 10 with a walk and a game four home run, a rare bright spot as the Giants were swept. In 1991, the Yomiuri shortstop took home his third Gold Glove while hitting .251/.330/.312 with a career-best 36 RBI. He laid down 66 successful sacrifice hits, breaking his own record; his mark would later be topped by Shinya Miyamoto. The next year, Masahiro had a .258/.312/.345 and led the Central League with 42 sacrifice hits. Takahiro Ikeyama broke his Gold Glove run at short. Kawai hit .290/.350/.381 in 1993 and made his second All-Star appearance while winning his fourth Gold Glove. His 176 total bases and 23 doubles were career highs and his 45 sacrifice hits gave him the Central League lead for a fourth consecutive year. Masahiro scored a career-high 69 runs in 1994 and hit .302/.376/.357, setting highs in average and OBP as well. He finished 9th in the Central League in average and won his fifth Gold Glove. He only batted .091/.160/.136 in the 1994 Japan Series but Yomiuri still won. In 1995, the 30-year-old veteran produced at a .261/.348/.313 rate and lost the Gold Glove to Kenjiro Nomura. His 47 sacrifice hits led the league. The next season, Kawai batted just .232/.310/.277 and won his sixth and final Gold Glove; he also led in sacrifice hits for the sixth time (56). He was 4 for 13 with 4 walks in the 1996 Japan Series. He capped his 7th sacrifice hit title in 8 years and the last of his career by laying down 45 in 1997, when he hit .288/.355/.392. Masahiro batted .256/.301/.327 during the 1998 season and he failed to reach 100 games played for the first time in six years as Daisuke Motoki was used regularly at short; Kawai remained the starter. He became the chairman of the board of the Japan Professional Baseball Players Association that winter; he would hold the job for three years before Kazuyoshi Tatsunami took his place. By 1999, though, he was on the bench usually, hitting .295/.371/.302 in 149 AB and 82 games, in a backup role again after a decade as the starter. Tomohiro Nioka was now the starting shortstop and would hold the role for years. Kawai had only 58 AB in 54 games in 2000, batting .190/.294/.207 (he was 0 for 1 with a sacrifice in the 2000 Japan Series) and 52 AB in 73 games the next season, hitting .288/.315/.462. His career had come full-circle from defensive sub in the 1980s to starter in the 1990s to defensive sub in the 2000s. In 2002, the 37-year-old produced at a .219/.246/.289 rate in 132 AB over 88 games, backing up Nioka at short, Motoki at third and Toshihisa Nishi at second base. In the 2002 Japan Series, he played one game at third as a defensive sub. His brightest moment may have been in 2003; though he hit only .238/.247/.300 in 80 AB over 72 games and was rarely playing short (primarily subbing for Akira Eto and Motoki at third), he won national acclaim when he laid down his 512th career sacrifice hit. This broke Eddie Collins' world record and got significant media attention in Japan. Robert Whiting, perhaps using a fair bit of hyperbole, says that it "was greeted with as much fanfare as if he had surpassed the home run record. There were fireworks on the Tokyo Dome electronic scoreboard and a flowery ceremony involving Kawai's wife and children, accompanied by tears of joy all around." Yomiuri then tried to pressure him to retire but he refused and the club released him after 20 years with them. Kawai caught on with the Chunichi Dragons for 2004 and hit .261/.393/.391 in 23 AB, playing 80 games, almost exclusively as Tatsunami's backup at third base. In the 2004 Japan Series, he played three games at third and did not bat. In 2005, the 40-year-old again was the defensive substitute at third. He hit .294/.294/.412 in 17 AB over 69 games. For his final season, he batted .273/.304/.273 in 22 AB in 51 games. He played one game in the 2006 Japan Series and, very fittingly, laid down a successful sacrifice bunt in his final plate appearance after 23 years in Nippon Professional Baseball. His career offensive line read .266/.333/.345 with 533 sacrifice hits in 1,909 games. Ken Hirano (451) was second all-time in Nippon Professional Baseball in sacrifice hits at the time of Kawai's retirement with no other player within 200. Kawai retired after the 2006 season and was hired by Chunichi as a coach.

Some of Takayoshi Nagamine's original students to achieve black belt in the United States included Jim Driggs, Rick Kemper, Al Rozier, Bill George, Dave Williams and Steve Rafferty. Takayoshi also taught clinics and seminars in the Ohio region and around the United States until he returned to Okinawa in 1979. Takayoshi returned to Okinawa in order to assist his father, Shoshin Nagamine with the running of the World Honbu Dojo and the World Matsubayashi-ryu (Shorin-ryu) Karate-do Association (WMKA). In 1991, Shoshin Nagamine retired from running the Matsubayashi-ryu organisation and in a speech passed the leadership on to his son, Takayoshi. In 1992 Takayoshi called together senior instructors in Okinawa and the United States and formed what is now known as the World Matsubayashi-ryu (Shorin-ryu) Karate-do Association (WMKA). In 1997 after his father's death, Takayoshi took the position as the second Sōke (head) of the Matsubayashi-ryu Karate-do system. Soke Nagamine moved from Long Island, NY in 2004 leaving Sensei Racanelli to handel the WMKA Administration. In October 2008, Takayoshi was promoted to the rank of Hanshisei 10th Dan in Matsubayashi-ryu. Takayoshi has helped with the development, establishment and teaching at dojos throughout the world including, but not limited to Australia, United States, Germany, Norway, Ireland and Canada. Students from around the world have attended seminars with Takayoshi Nagamine. Affiliates have attended clinics in Australia, Canada, United States, and Europe. At the time of Takayoshi Nagamine's death, there are still people who honor and continue to train and follow the ideals of Matsubayashi Ryu, who are not members of the WMKA. Soke Nagamine accepts all who follow in the TRUE traditional training of his father Nagamine Shoshin OSensei as part of the Matsubayashi Ryu Karatedo Family.

Due to her longevity and resilience in the industry, she has been often referred by critics and music publications as the "Teen Queen" of Japan, "Queen of J-Pop", and the "Japanese Madonna or Janet Jackson". Born in Naha	Namie Amuro (安室奈美恵 Amuro Namie, born September 20, 1977) is a Japanese singer, dancer, fashion model, actress and businesswoman. She achieved popularity by a series of successful singles and albums, both exploring different genres and working with producers and musicians outside of Japan, one of the first Japanese artists to do so at the time. Due to her longevity and resilience in the industry, she has been often referred by critics and music publications as the "Teen Queen" of Japan, "Queen of J-Pop", and the "Japanese Madonna or Janet Jackson". Born in Naha, Okinawa, Amuro debuted in music as an idol girl with the band Super Monkey's at age 14. Although majority of their releases were unsuccessful in Japan, Amuro's venturing in modelling fashion and acting helped the group gain attention on their single "Try Me (Watashi o Shinjite)". Retitling themselves as "Namie Amuro with Super Monkey’s" to achieve further success, they released a studio album and a compilation. She signed with Avex Trax in 1995 to released her debut single “"Body Feels Exit", the lead single from her best-selling album Sweet 19 Blues (1996). She achieved large success with her single "Can You Celebrate?", which is still the best-selling single from a female artist in Japan. Transitioning into westernised R&B music, she released her third album Genius 2000 (2000). As she was beginning to mould her well-known signature R&B sound, sales started to decline by the release of her fifth album Style (2003). But in 2007, Play, her eight studio album, was a period of her resurgence with sales. She then moved from R&B, onto electronic dance music with her tenth album Uncontrolled (2012), and has since recorded primarily in English language, including her most recent album Genic (2015). Though Amuro has been credited as a record producer and songwriter in some of her releases, she has remained solely as a recording artist, with many of her singles hitting number one including "Chase the Chance", "A Walk in the Park", "Dreaming I Was Dreaming", "I Have Never Seen", "Wild", and an extended play single 60s 70s 80s. Alongside this, her compilation albums 181920 (1998) and Best Fiction (2008) are two of the best-selling greatest hits albums in Japan. Having sold more than 30 million records in Japan, Namie Amuro is recognized as the 12th best-selling artist, the fourth best-selling solo artist, and third best-selling female artist in that region according to The Richest. She has been recognized at several award ceremonies, including being a recipient at the World Music Awards, Japan Record Awards, Japan Gold Disc Awards, amongst many others. Recording to calculated results by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ), she has a total of 43 million certified units. Her album Sweet 19 Blues was the best-selling album of Japan, until it was released by several more entries during most recent years.

Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota	Chris "Buddha" Michalek (July 23, 1971 – December 16, 2010) was an American harmonica player. Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, he was an accomplished modern diatonic harmonica player in many styles including Jazz, Funk, Blues and World Music. Michalek was also the organizer of the Global Harmonica Summit in 2000. Michalek was known for using the overblow technique, which is used to play chromatically on the diatonic harmonica. When he was a teenager, Michalek's harmonicostic talents were discovered by members of the Twin Cities Harmonica Society, including the prominent harmonica player and one-time Harmonicat Dick Gardner. It was the music of Howard Levy that opened Chris' eyes to the possibilities of the harmonica. Levy's overblow, a kind of controlled bend, makes available all notes on the diatonic harmonica. It allowed the combination the excellent tone of the diatonic harmonica with the melodic possibilities of the chromatic. An instrument that once seemed limited became somewhat flexible. Chris quickly began to play jazz and to experiment with other styles of music. He was still playing up until recently with well-known bassist Mahlon Hawk in the Buddha's Groove. He died of a stroke on December 16, 2010.

Norton was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She studied as a child at the University of Minnesota with William Lindsay, who later introduced her to Dame Myra Hess. Hess was so impressed with the 15-year-old Norton's playing that she arranged for Norton to study in England in 1923 with Hess's own mentor, the famed pedagogue Tobias Matthay, with whom Norton would remain in association for 8 years. Eunice Norton made her first appearance within that same year with the Queen’s Hall Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Sir Henry Wood, who subsequently took Norton on tour as soloist throughout the provinces. She played many recitals at that time in Wigmore Hall, and was soloist with the Manchester, Birmingham, and B.B.C. Symphonies under Sirs Hamilton Harty and Adrian Boult. After winning the Chappell Gold Medal and the London Bach Prize in 1927, she performed in Vienna, The Hague, Paris, and Leipzig with the famous Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. In Berlin alone, she gave more than twenty concerts to dazzling critical reviews, including a Bach concert about which musicologist and critic Alfred Einstein wrote, "Her Bach is played as Bach would have wished to hear it." In Amsterdam, Paderewski said after hearing her Chopin, "You will play in all the great halls of the world." As if fulfilling this prediction, Norton soon played in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Budapest. In the United States, she made her formal debut at Carnegie Hall and later premiered many new works at frequent concert appearances at Town Hall. She was invited by Koussevitzsky to play with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and was heard from coast to coast as recitalist and soloist with the New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, and Chicago symphonies under Dobrowen, Verbrugghen, Stokowski, Ormandy, Stock, Reiner, and Steinberg. One highlight from this period was her premiereperformance and recording with RCA Victor of Hindemith's Kammermusik No. 2, with Stokowski conducting. An important milestone occurred in Norton's development when she heard Artur Schnabel's performances of Beethoven's piano sonatas in 1932. She spent three successive seasons under his tutelage in Berlin and Italy, and later enjoyed many rewarding years of friendship and association with him. Yet, possibly the most important factor in Norton's evolution as an artist occurred during the years which she spent away from the concert stage developing her playing through more secluded work. It was then that she founded Pittsburgh’s chapter of the New Friends of Music, which still exists today as the Pittsburgh Chamber Music Society, the city’s premiere chamber music series.She later founded the Peacham Music Festival in Vermont, where many remarkable live recordings of her maturing performances were produced. Norton performed with the American Chamber Orchestra, the Juilliard, Budapest, Griller, and Curtis String Quartets, at the White House for President Hoover, a Schnabel memorial concert at Lincoln Center, an all Beethoven recital at Rockefeller University, and the first radio broadcast of Bach's Goldberg Variations in the USA.

Rudd is an American Chemical Engineer and Donald C. Slichter Professor Emeritus of Engineering Research at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He is known for his influential work in process engineering, in particular for introducing computer aided process synthesis design strategies for large scale chemical industries. He co-wrote the first textbook in process engineering, and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1978. Rudd was born in 1935 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and received his BS in 1956 and his Ph.d. in 1959 in Chemical Engineering under Neal Amundson from the University of Minnesota. He was an assistant professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor before joining the Chemical and Biological Engineering department at University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1961.At the University of Wisconsin he developed the field of process synthesis in computerized process design.

He is most famous for being the creator of Occidental, a naturalistic constructed language based on the Indo-European languages, which was initially published in 1922. An Estonian of ethnic Baltic German origin, he studied in Saint Petersburg and spent most of his later professional life in Tallinn, Estonia. He was born at Olwiopol, Russian Empire (now part of Pervomaisk, Mykolaiv Oblast, Ukraine). At first an adherent of Volapük, de Wahl later became one of the first users of Esperanto and advised Ludwig Zamenhof on some points of grammar and vocabulary of that language. After several years he abandoned Esperanto, and in the following decades he worked on the problem of the ideal form of an international auxiliary language. In 1922 he published a "key" to a new language, Occidental, and the first number of a periodical entitled Kosmoglott (later Cosmoglotta), written in that language. In following years, de Wahl participated in discussions about Occidental, and allowed the language to develop gradually as a result of the recommendations of its users. After World War II started in 1939, he had only intermittent contacts with the Occidentalist movement, which had become centred in Switzerland. He became a member of the Committee of Linguistic Advisors, part of the International Auxiliary Language Association, which would present Interlingua in 1951. The last years of his life were spent in a sanatorium in Tallinn, Estonia, where he died in 1948. Shortly afterwards, in 1949, the name of Occidental was changed to Interlingue. Later, in 1951, Interlingua was unveiled; this led to the present insignificance of Interlingue (Occidental).

Following a downturn and near-bankruptcy, Iwata became the president of HAL Laboratory in 1993 at the insistence of Nintendo President Hiroshi Yamauchi and brought financial stability to the company. In the following years, he assisted in the development of the Pokémon and Super Smash Bros. series. Iwata joined Nintendo as the head of its corporate-planning division in 2000. Nintendo soon saw notable growth with Iwata's assistance and, as a result, he succeeded Yamauchi as the company's president in May 2002. Under Iwata's direction, Nintendo developed the Nintendo DS and Wii video game consoles, helping the company to achieve financial success in the industry. As a self-declared gamer, he focused on expanding the appeal of video games across all demographics through a "blue ocean" business strategy. The company attained record profits by 2009, and Barron's placed Iwata among the top 30 CEOs worldwide. Iwata subsequently expanded his blue ocean strategy by defining a quality of life product line for the Wii that later evolved into a ten-year business strategy to create stand-alone products. Later hardware releases like the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U proved far less profitable than the Wii, and Nintendo's net sales fell by two-thirds from 2009 to 2012; the company saw its first operating losses in 30 years during this time. Iwata voluntarily halved his salary as an apology in both 2011 and 2014. In 2015, after several years of refusal, Iwata put a portion of Nintendo's focus into the rapidly growing mobile game market; a landmark partnership with mobile provider DeNA was established that March. Throughout his career, Iwata built a strong relationship with Nintendo fans through social media and his regular appearances in Iwata Asks and Nintendo Direct; he accordingly became the public face of the company. In June 2014, a tumor in his bile duct was discovered during a routine physical exam. It was removed, and Iwata returned to work in October of that year. The issue resurfaced in 2015, and Iwata died at the age of 55 from its complications on July 11. Members of the gaming industry and fans alike expressed their sadness over his death through public announcements and social media, and fans worldwide established temporary memorials. Iwata was posthumously granted the Lifetime Achievement Award at both the 2015 Golden Joystick Awards and the 2016 DICE Awards.

He taught sculpture at Yogyakarta State University (formerly IKIP Yogyakarta) and the Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta. He was born on July 2, 1932, in Salatiga, Central Java, Dutch East Indies. Like many Indonesians, he was born with just one name, Sunarso. He took the name Edhi Sunarso, after a fellow fighter who was killed during the Indonesian National Revolution for independence from the Netherlands. In 1942, Sunarso was captured by Dutch forces during a pro-independence mission in Bandung. He was imprisoned in Kebonwaru, Bandung, by the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army until 1949. Sunarso initially began sculpting and practicing art while detained in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army's prison. Upon his release in 1949 (and the independence of Indonesia), Sunarso enrolled in the Indonesian College of Fine Arts (ASRI), now known as the Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta (ISI). He then won a scholarship from UNESCO to attend the Visva Bharati Robindrannat Tagore University in India. In 1956, Edhi Sunarso was awarded second prize at an international competition in the United Kingdom for his stone sculpture, "The Unknown Political Prisoner." His prize won the attention of Indonesian officials, including President Sukarno. During the 1950s, Sukarno had ordered the destruction of statues and monuments which had been erected by Dutch authorities during the colonial era. Sukarno commissioned Sunarso and his colleagues in 1958 to create a sculpture which would greet athletes arriving for the 1962 Asian Games four years later. By 1959, Sunarso had completed the Selamat Datang Monument, which means "Welcome" in Bahasa Indonesian, which is now considered an important Jakarta landmark. Sukarno commissioned Sunarso to complete several other monuments located throughout Jakarta. In 1964, he installed the Irian Jaya Liberation at Lapangan Banteng to mark the Indonesian takeover of West Papua (Netherlands New Guinea). The Dirgantara statue, located in Pancoran, South Jakarta, was built in 1966. First commissioned by Sukarno before he was overthrown in 1967, the former President reportedly considered selling his own car to fund the construction of Dirgantara, which "symbolizes courage, gallantry and dedication in aviation." Dirgantara underwent its first cleaning and restoration in 2014. Sunarso also crafted sculptures for individual collectors, as well as dioramas commissioned by the Government of Indonesia. Edhi Sunarso died from heart failure following prostate surgery in Yogyakarta on January 4, 2016, at the age of 83. He was buried beside his late wife in the Girisapto Imogiri Artist Cemetery in Bantul, Special Region of Yogyakarta. Sunarso was survived by his two daughters and two sons.

Goldfaden is considered the father of the Jewish modern theatre. In 1876 he founded in Romania what is generally credited as the world's first professional Yiddish-language theater troupe. He was also responsible for the first Hebrew-language play performed in the United States. The Avram Goldfaden Festival of Iaşi, Romania, is named and held in his honour. Jacob Sternberg called him "the Prince Charming who woke up the lethargic Romanian Jewish culture." Israil Bercovici wrote of his works: "we find points in common with what we now call 'total theater'. In many of his plays he alternates prose and verse, pantomime and dance, moments of acrobatics and some of jonglerie, and even of spiritualism..."

Although her songs were mostly secular in nature (being the popular music of the time in Morocco), many of the melodies have later been modified to be fit religious Jewish liturgical songs (called piyyutim) as well. Born in Sefrou	Zohra Al Fassiya (Arabic: زهرة الفاسية‎‎, Hebrew: זוהרה אלפסיה‎‎) was a Moroccan singer and poet.  Considered as the queen of the melhoun and gharnati genres, and one of the pioneers of modern Arabic music, she was the first female recording artist in Morocco, and her songs were widely celebrated throughout Morocco and Algeria, where she collaborated with lyricists and musicians from Oran and Tlemcen. Although her songs were mostly secular in nature (being the popular music of the time in Morocco), many of the melodies have later been modified to be fit religious Jewish liturgical songs (called piyyutim) as well. Born in Sefrou, near Fez, at the feet of the mountains of Atlas in a modest Moroccan Jewish family, she started to sing at a very early age when she performed religious songs at her synagogue. During her youth, she started to sing in coffee houses and cabarets near towns and in Casablanca. Her songs were mostly secular gharanti songs (Andalusian Arabic songs originally from Granada, Spain, and very popular among the Muslims of Andalusian background and Moroccan and Algerian Jews in the 19th century), as well as Malhun, which are long Moroccan poems. In the 40's, she had her own orchestra and started to write her own songs. She was heavily aired on radio stations, both in Morocco and Algeria, and was extremely well known and loved by the public. Al Fassiya's Jewish identity was not considered to be problematic in Morocco during the height of her fame. In fact, the King of Morocco, Mohammed V, was so impressed by her voice that he invited her to sing at his court. Al Fassiya also worked with other artists such as Samy Elmaghribi, who wrote some of her songs. She released more than 17 albums between the years 1947-1957 . In 1962, following many fellow Mizrahi Jews who fled Arab countries due to mounting persecution following the establishment of the State of Israel, Al Fassiya immigrated to Israel. However, despite her superstar status in Morocco and North Africa, Al Fassiya's talent went unrecognized in Israel outside of the Moroccan immigrant community, as the state-run media and cultural institutions preferred to promote Western sounding music. As with many Mizrahi / Sephardi Jewish immigrants (Jews from Arab and Islamic countries), Al Fassiya faced discrimination in Israel, and she came to live in miserable and lonely conditions in Ashkelon. Despite this humiliating fate, Al Fassiya was often invited to sing at private celebrations (such as weddings) in the Moroccan community in Israel. Israeli-Moroccan poet Erez Biton, who visited her in Ashkelon, was so moved by her fate that he dedicated a poem to her story; this poem has now been added to the national school curriculum in Israel, and serves as a centrepiece in discussion of the state's harsh Westernization policies in the 20th Century. In her last years, Zohra Al Fassiya lived in a nursing home in Ashkelon. She died at age 89 in 1994 and was buried there.

He was born in the town of Zolotonosha, Russian Empire (currently in Ukraine). As an adult he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party but was expelled when he formed a Zionist Socialist Workers Union in Yekaterinoslav. Subsequently, he helped form the Poale Zion party and devoted his life to promoting the party in Russia, Europe, and America. When the Russian social democrats came to power, Borochov returned to Russia in March 1917 to lead the Poale Zion. He became ill and died in Kiev of pneumonia in December 1917. Borochov became highly influential in the Zionist movement because he explained nationalism in general, and Jewish Nationalism in particular in terms of Marxist class struggle and dialectical materialism. Borochov predicted, correctly, that nationalist forces would be more important in determining events than economic and class considerations, especially as concerned the Jews. Borochov argued that the class structure of European Jews resembled an inverted class pyramid where few Jews occupied the productive layers of society as workers. The Jews would migrate from country to country as they were forced out of their chosen professions by a "stychic process" which would ultimately force migration to Palestine, where they would form a proletarian basis in order to carry out Marxist class struggle. A key part of Borochovian ideology was that the Arab and Jewish working classes had a common proletarian interest and would participate in the class struggle together once Jews had returned to Palestine. In his last recorded speech, he said: Many point out the obstacles which we encounter in our colonization work. Some say that the Turkish law hinders our work, others contend that Palestine is insignificantly small, and still others charge us with the odious crime of wishing to oppress and expel the Arabs from Palestine...When the waste lands are prepared for colonization, when modern technique is introduced, and when the other obstacles are removed, there will be sufficient land to accommodate both the Jews and the Arabs. Normal relations between the Jews and Arabs will and must prevail. Borochov, along with Nachman Syrkin is considered a father of socialist Zionism. Borochov's ideas were influential in convincing Jewish youth from Europe to move to Palestine. However, Borochov's theories remained most influential in Eastern Europe, where they formed the basis of the Left Poale Zionist movement which was active in Poland during the interwar years. Indeed, Borochov's vision of class struggle in Palestine was widely viewed as untenable by the 1910s, with Jewish migrants to Palestine struggling to establish an economic foothold and with interclass cooperation seemingly necessary, and his theories dimmed in popularity there. Borochov, for years an advocate for a doctrinaire Marxist Zionism, himself seemed to repudiate his former vision of class struggle in Palestine in speeches towards the end of his life. Borochov insisted that he was a Social Democrat, but Borochov's Left Poale Zion followers continued to vigorously advocate class struggle both in Palestine and eastern Europe, supporting the February Revolution of 1917. Borochov returned to Russia in August 1917 attended the Third All-Russian Poalei Tziyon Party congress to argue for socialist settlement in Palestine, The Poalei Tziyon conference selected Borochov as a delegate the Conference of Nationalities where he issued a paper calling for Russia as a decentralized socialist commonwealth of nations (“Rossiia kak sodruzhestvo narodov”). Borochov caught pneumonia while on a speaking tour and died in Kiev on December 17, 1917 at the age of 36. The Russian Poale Zion movement split into two factions over attitudes towards the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. The Poale Zion Left formed a "Borochov Brigade" to join the Red Army during the Russian Civil War and ultimately split from the main Poale Zion party to become the Jewish Communist Party (Poalei Zion) in 1919 and would go on to join the Jewish section (Yevsektsiya) of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union while the social democratic Right Poale Zion was banned. The international Poale Zion movement also split into left and right factions, which have evolved into the modern Israeli political parties of Mapam (later Meretz) and the Israeli Labor Party respectively. The European branch of the Left Poale Zion movement was effectively destroyed by the early 1950s; many of its members were killed by the Nazis during World War II, and the surviving activists were persecuted and ultimately outlawed under the various post-war Communist regimes. While most Zionists regarded Yiddish as a derivative language characteristic of the Jewish Diaspora and to be abandoned by the Jewish people in favor of Hebrew, Borochov was a committed Yiddishist and Yiddish philologist and wrote extensively on the importance of the language. He is considered the founder of modern Yiddish studies. Borochov’s contributions were recognized in various ways by the early Jewish settlement in Palestine. For example, the first workers' neighborhood in the country, in what later became the city of Giv'atayim, was named after Borochov.

Locche is often cited as one of the finest defensive boxers of all time, second only to Young Griffo. Locche was known as "El Intocable" ("The Untouchable") due to his defensive mastery, and became Light Welterweight World Champion in Tokyo, Japan on December 12, 1968, after defeating Paul Takeshi Fuji by technical knockout after Fuji refused to start the 10th round out of frustration because of exhaustion and his inability to connect punches on "The Untouchable," according to the Argentine boxing commentators' recount of the bout (Dotora, 2004). Locche became an idol in Argentina and routinely sold out the Luna Park, Buenos Aires every time he fought at the well known boxing arena. His boxing style made him a legend. He possessed uncanny reflexes that allowed him to stand in front of his opponents with his hands literally at his sides, behind his back or even resting on his knees as he slipped, bobbed and weaved to avoid his opponent’s punches. Unfortunately Locche's outstanding defensive skills were not equally matched by his offensive response, as he was not generally considered to be a powerful puncher. Numerous Argentine sources also cite the fact that Locche's approach towards submitting himself to traditional boxing training and discipline was sometimes lackadaisical. For example, Locche was a known habitual cigarette smoker throughout most if not all of his boxing career and his adherence to the strict dietary requirements of his trade was often quite flexible. It was not unusual to see his seconds crowd around him during the 1 minute break between rounds where he would be puffing furiously on a cigarette. Locche defended his title six times, against Carlos Hernandez, Joao Henrique, Adolph Pruitt, Antonio Cervantes and Domingo Barrera Corpas, to lose it in Panama to Alfonso Frazier on March 10, 1972. Locche failed to regain the World Champion belt in a rematch with Cervantes (a.k.a., Kid Pambelé) and retired in 1975. He was champion of Mendoza, Argentina, and South American lightweight and Jr. welterweight. He debuted at the age of 9, and his amateur record was 117-5-0. Locche turned professional at the age of 19 and amassed a record of 117-4-14 (14 KOs). He was inducted to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2003. The Ring has retrospectively certified him as lineal Junior Welterweight champion from 1968 to 1972. Locche died in Las Heras in 2005, of heart failure.

Some of the ancient writers say that Alexander made him satrap of Egypt; but this is incorrect, for Arrian expressly states that the other nomarchs were independent of him, except that they had to pay to him the tributes of their districts. It would, however, appear that he had no difficulty in extending his depredations over all Egypt, and it is possible that he would have taken the title of satrap. It is told that his rapacity knew no bounds, that he exercised his office solely for his own advantage. When there was a scarcity of grain, which was less severe in Egypt than in the neighbouring countries, he at first forbade its export from Egypt. But when the nomarchs represented to him that this measure prevented them from raising the proper amount of tribute, he permitted the export of grain, but placed a heavy export duty on it. On another occasion, when the price of grain was ten drachmas, Cleomenes bought it up and sold it at 32 drachmas; and in other ways he interfered with the markets for his own gain. Alexander had entrusted him to build the new city of Alexandria. Cleomenes informed the people of Canopus, then the chief emporium of Egypt, that he must move them to the new city. To avert such an evil they provided him with a large sum of money. But, as the building of Alexandria advanced, he again demanded that the people of Canopus pay him a large sum of money, which they could not pay. So this provided him with the excuse for removing them. He also made money out of the superstitions of the people. After one of his boys had been killed by a crocodile, he ordered the crocodiles be destroyed. But, in return for all the money which the priests gathering to save their sacred animals, he revoked his order. On another occasion he sent for the priests, and informed them that the religious establishment was too expensive and must be reduced. So the priests handed over to him the treasures of their temples. So he then left them undisturbed. Alexander was informed of Cleomenes' actions, but found it convenient to take no notice of them. But after his return to Babylon in 323 BC, he wrote to Cleomenes, commanding him to erect at Alexandria a splendid monument to Hephaestion, and promised that if this work was zealously performed, he would overlook his misconduct. In the distribution of Alexander's empire after his death (323 BC), Cleomenes remained in Egypt as satrap under Ptolemy, who put him to death on the suspicion of his favouring Perdiccas. The effect, if not also a cause, of this act was that Ptolemy was then able to take possession of Cleomenes' accumulated wealth, which amounted to 8000 talents.

Ikeda's music is concerned primarily with sound in a variety of "raw" states, such as sine tones and noise, often using frequencies at the edges of the range of human hearing. The conclusion of his album +/- features just such a tone; of it, Ikeda says "a high frequency sound is used that the listener becomes aware of only upon its disappearance" (from the CD booklet). Rhythmically, Ikeda's music is highly imaginative, exploiting beat patterns and, at times, using a variety of discrete tones and noise to create the semblance of a drum machine. His work also encroaches on the world of ambient music; many tracks on his albums are concerned with slowly evolving soundscapes, with little or no sense of pulse. Ryoji Ikeda was born in Gifu, Japan in 1966. In addition to working as a solo artist, he has also collaborated with, among others, Carsten Nicolai (under the name "Cyclo.") and the art collective Dumb Type. His work matrix won the Golden Nica Award in 2001. In 2004, the dormant Saarinen-designed TWA Flight Center (now Jetblue Terminal 5) at JFK Airport briefly hosted an art exhibition called Terminal 5 curated by Rachel K. Ward and featuring the work of 18 artists including Ikeda. The show featured work, lectures and temporary installations drawing inspiration from the idea of travel — and the terminal's architecture. The show was to run from October 1, 2004 to January 31, 2005 — though it closed abruptly after the building itself was vandalized during the opening party. In May – June 2011 a presentation of three of the artist's immersive audio/visual projects, The Transfinite, was exhibited at the Park Avenue Armory.

He was born the eldest of twelve children in Uromi in the present Edo State of Nigeria. His Esan parents were Anastasius Okotako Enahoro (d. 1968) and Fidelia Inibokun née Ogbidi Okojie (d. 1969). Enahoro has had a long and distinguished career in the press, politics, the civil service and the pro-democracy movement. Educated at the Government School Uromi, Government School Owo and King's College, Lagos, Enahoro became the editor of Nnamdi Azikiwe's newspaper, the Southern Nigerian Defender, Ibadan, in 1944 at the age of 21, thus becoming Nigeria's youngest editor ever. He later became the editor of Zik's Comet, Kano, 1945–49, associate editor of West African Pilot, Lagos, and editor-in-chief of Morning Star from 1950 to 1953. In 1953, Enahoro became the first to move the motion for Nigeria's independence which was eventually granted in 1960 after several political setbacks and defeats in parliament. Enahoro has been regarded by academics and many Nigerians as the "Father of Nigeria State". However, his motion for Nigeria's Independence suffered setbacks in parliament on several occasions with the northern members of parliament staging a walkout as a consequence of the motion. Notwithstanding the defeat in parliament, a popular movement was started on account of this motion and the pressure was now built up against colonialism and there was agitations for independence for Nigeria, or at least self governance. S.L. Akintola attempted to revisit the motion for Nigeria's independence in 1957 and though his motion was passed by parliament it was not acquiesced to by the British colonial authorities and it therefore failed. In August 1958, Remi Fani-Kayode revisited Enahoro's motion and the motion was again passed by parliament but its date was not approved by the British. Fani-Kayode's motion had called for independence to be granted to Nigeria on April 2, 1960. Nigeria was granted independence on October 1, 1960. In furtherance of the ever recurring Enahoro's Motion, a further motion was proposed to Parliament by Sir Tafawa Balewa in 1959 and it was passed. As a consequence of the sustained pressure, the colonial governor announced the decision of the Queen of England to grant her independence in 1960.

She went on to win numerous competitions, and was sponsored to attend a women’s boarding school in Nagoya which specialized in swimming, but the sudden death of her parents in 1931 forced her return home. Yet she was selected for the Japanese Olympic swimming team for the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and won the silver medal in the 200 m breaststroke event.

During the post-Olympic celebration after her return to Japan, she stated that she was considering to retire from competitive swimming due to family issues, but then Tokyo mayor Hidejirō Nagata reportedly asked her why she did not bring back a gold medal.

He was baptized as a Christian by priest Uemura Masahisa in 1897. After graduation, he worked in the university's Publishing Department, then in 1903 began writing literary, art, and cultural criticism for the Yomiuri Shinbun newspaper. In 1904 he published his first novel, Sekibaku (Solitude), in the Shinshosetsu literary magazine, Jin’ai (Dust) in 1907, and gained attention with a naturalist novel, Doko-e (Whither?), published in serial form in Waseda bungaku through 1908. He left the newspaper in 1910 to become a full-time author, and in 1911 his novel Doro ningyō (The Mud Doll) gained further acclaim.

Major novels include Ushibeya no nioi (The Stench of the Stable, 1916) and Shisha seisha (The Dead and the Living, 1916); his best known plays are perhaps Jinsei no kōfuku (The Happiness of Human Life, 1924) and Tenshi hokaku (Captive Angels, 1947); and outstanding examples of his criticism include Bundan jimbutsu hyōron (Critical Essays on Literary Figures), Shisō mushisō (Thought and Non-Thought, 1938), Bundanteki jijoden (A Literary Autobiography, 1938), Sakka ron (A Study of Writers, 1941-2), Shizenshugi seisuishi (The Rise and Fall of Naturalism, 1948), and Uchimura Kanzō (1949).

She then completed a certificate in educational studies at the Université de Lyon and a certificate in child care studies at the University of London. Tremblay was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons in the 1993 federal election for the riding of Rimouski—Témiscouata. She was re-elected in the 1997 election for the riding of Rimouski-Mitis and in the 2000 election for Rimouski-Neigette-et-La Mitis. She announced her intention not to run again in the 2004 federal election. She was occasionally a controversial figure, once pointing out that Quebec Premier Jean Charest's first name was really "John" in an attempt to discredit him as a representative of the true Quebec; the Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe distanced himself from this comment. Tremblay also made similar comments attacking Radio-Canada journalist Joyce Napier for not having a francophone name, and pop singer Céline Dion for purportedly turning her back on her Québécoise identity in her pursuit of pop stardom. Following Tremblay's announcement of her retirement from the House of Commons, Louise Thibault, a municipal councillor in Le Bic, became the Bloc Québécois candidate in the new riding of Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques, and won the 2004 election. Tremblay ran in the resulting by-election to fill Thibault's municipal council seat, running primarily on a campaign of opposing the then-proposed amalgamation of Le Bic with Rimouski. She lost narrowly to Pierre Garon, a local farmer and trucker who had not previously been active in politics.

Born in Montreal	Air Vice-Marshal Arthur Lorne James CBE, RCAF (September 1903 – 1964) was a Canadian air force officer who was instrumental in the evolution of the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II and the early years of the Cold War, leading to its close cooperation with the United States Air Force in the defence of North America. Born in Montreal in September 1903, James was educated there and attended McGill University where he graduated with a B.Sc. in Civil Engineering. He enlisted in the RCAF during its formative year in 1924. He attained the rank of Sergeant in the technical branch before being commissioned as a Pilot Officer in 1926 upon earning his pilot wings. Throughout the rest of the 1920s he was active in many of the RCAF's early missions including forest fire patrols, aerial photography, and test flying.

This officer's display of energy, leadership and integrity, combined with a pleasing personality, has been an inspiration to all those with whom he comes in contact.

The right-handed pitcher, a native of Montreal	Raymond Joseph Robert Daviault (born May 27, 1934) is a retired Canadian professional baseball player. The right-handed pitcher, a native of Montreal, Quebec, had an 11-season (1953–1963) professional career, but spent only part of one season in the Major Leagues, appearing in 36 games (all but three in relief) for the 1962 New York Mets, the first season in that expansion team's history. He stood 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg). Daviault had been selected by the Mets with the 18th pick in the 1961 Major League Baseball expansion draft, even though he had yet to pitch a single inning in the Majors. In 1961, his ninth season in the minors, he had appeared in 58 games and 105 innings pitched for the Triple-A Tacoma Giants, fashioning a 10–9 record and an earned run average of 3.17. In 1962, he broke spring training camp on the Mets' inaugural roster, and made his MLB debut on April 13 at the Polo Grounds against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Entering the game in the eighth inning with the Mets down, 3–2, he walked Dick Groat, threw a wild pitch, retired Bob Skinner on a ground ball (with Groat advancing to third base), then uncorked a second wild pitch to score Groat and increase the Pirate lead to 4–2. He also walked three batters in the ninth inning but allowed no further scoring as Pittsburgh ended up winning, 4–3. He earned his only MLB victory on July 7 against the St. Louis Cardinals, also at the Polo Grounds. He came into a 3–3 tie in the eighth inning, and immediately dodged a bullet when Cardinal baserunner Dal Maxvill failed to touch third base and was called out to kill a St. Louis rally. Then, in the ninth, Daviault surrendered a go-ahead home run to the Cardinals' Curt Flood. But, in the bottom of the inning, the Mets' Marv Throneberry hit a two-run, walk-off home run off Ernie Broglio to give New York and Daviault a come-from-behind, 5–4 win. That 1962 Mets team had a record of 40-120, still the record for most losses by a Major League Baseball team in a single season. In 36 MLB games and 81 innings pitched, Daviault allowed 92 hits and 48 walks; he struck out 51.

Brown has gone through several stylistic and thematic periods. He gained notice in alternative comics circles in the 1980s for the surreal, scatological Ed the Happy Clown serial. After bringing Ed to an abrupt end, he delved into confessional autobiographical comics in the early 1990s and was strongly associated with fellow Toronto-based cartoonists Seth and Joe Matt, and the contemporary autobiographical comics trend. Two graphic novels came from this period: The Playboy (1992) and I Never Liked You (1994). Surprise mainstream success in the 2000s came with Louis Riel (2003), a historical-biographical graphic novel about rebel Métis leader Louis Riel. Paying for It (2011) drew controversy as a polemic in support of decriminalizing prostitution. Brown draws from a range of influences, including monster and superhero comic books, underground comix, and comic strips such as Harold Gray's Little Orphan Annie. His later works employ a sparse drawing style and flat dialogue. Rather than the traditional method of drawing complete pages, Brown draws individual panels without regard for page composition and assembles them into pages after completion. Since the late 1990s Brown has had a penchant for providing detailed annotations for his work and extensively altering and reformatting older works. Brown at first self-published his work as a minicomic called Yummy Fur beginning in 1983; Toronto publisher Vortex Comics began publishing the series as a comic book in 1986. The content tended towards controversial themes: a distributor and a printer dropped it in the late 1980s, and it has been held up at the Canada–United States border. Since 1991, Brown has associated himself with Montreal publisher Drawn and Quarterly. Following Louis Riel Brown ceased serializing his work to publish graphic novels directly. He has received grants from the Canada Council to complete Louis Riel and Paying for It.

An architect, he was called for professional purposes Louis de Soissons. de Soissons was born in Montreal, Canada, but moved in childhood with his family to London. In 1913 he won the first year of the Henry Jarvis scholarship of the Royal Institute of British Architects, enabling three years of European travel and study. The first major commission of the practice he set up (Louis de Soissons Partnership) was the 'master plan' (so-called - a very early use of the term) for Welwyn Garden City (1920), a planned town created by Ebenezer Howard, on cheap redundant farmland. Louis de Soissons was appointed architect for the town in 1920 and the practice was significantly involved in its development over the next 60 years. He designed the concrete Shredded Wheat factory for the eponymous Canadian company. Other important early projects included the Home Office and Duchy of Cornwall Estates in London, where the future Edward VIII was the effective client and the Nag's Head Estate in Bethnal Green, London, E2 which was one of the few private "slum clearance" projects undertaken by a private landlord. When young he had been much influenced by 18th century Italian architecture, and gained a reputation as a classical architect, but with a deep humanism resulting from his new town work. After the Second World War the firm expanded to Plymouth and Exeter to carry out a wide variety of architectural work. Nearly 50 War Cemeteries were designed for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in Greece and Italy. Later the practice’s buildings included a number of important buildings, such as the Wellcome Foundation, The Leathersellers Company, (a reconstruction in 1948 after wartime bombing), the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in Regent's Park and the International Wool Secretariat in Carlton Terrace, London. He also designed the Hobbs' Gates at The Oval cricket ground, in memory of Sir Jack Hobbs, the noted Surrey and England player, and a statue of George VI. The Crown Estates Commissioners retained the firm to restore Cumberland and Chester Terraces, by John Nash. For the MCC work has been carried out on seating. Work for academic institutions included Eton College, and Exeter and Cambridge Universities. In 1923 Louis de Soissons became a fellow of the RIBA and a member of both the Town Planning Institute, later RTPI, and the Société des Architectes Diplômés par le Gouvernement. He was made an academician - a fellow of the Royal Academy - in 1953 and was awarded the RIBA distinction in town planning in 1945. In the 1956 New Year Honours he was decorated with the CVO. The firm changed tack in the 1960s, and commercial work such as the Brighton Marina shows a greater deference to modernism. The firm's headquarters are now in Luton, Bedfordshire. Louis de Soissons married Elinor Penrose-Thackwell, by whom he had three sons: Philip (killed in action 1941), Maurice and Brian (1929–2009).

In the late 1960s, he first discovered Pt-catalyzed CH activation of alkanes and first provided mechanism supported by kinetic analysis, known as the Shilov system. In 1990 he received the Academian of Scienсes. Academian Shilov is the author of the famous book Activation and Catalytic Reactions of Saturated Hydrocarbons in the Presence of Metal Complexes together with Georgiy B. Shul'pin. In addition to his achievements, he first proposed dinitrogen reduction to ammonia in aqueous media by using organometallic complexes. His scientific interests have been published in more than 300 papers and cover research in chemical kinetics and catalysis, mechanisms of chemical reactions, chemical modeling of enzyme systems.

Born in Montreal, Quebec, Woloshen first attended Vanier College, where he worked with Super-8 film and video, then specialized in 16 mm independent film techniques at Concordia University in Montreal. He has since created animated and experimental films, which have been shown at screenings and festivals around the world. Working in camera-less animation since 1982, Woloshen has used scratches and lacerations on film to create emotional content. Woloshen is a Montreal-based camera less animator who has been making films since the late ‘70’s. He studied film at Concordia University, where he initially made documentaries and collage films, but the freedom and accessibility of scratch animation won him over. Since 1999 he has worked exclusively in 35mm CinemaScope, an oddity in the independent film world that is made possible by his otherwise thrifty means of production. His works have screened worldwide at festivals including the Montreal World Film Festival, Tampere International Short Film Festival, Annecy Animated Film Festival, Ottawa International Animation Festival, and I Castelli Animati in Rome. Woloshen is heavily inspired by music, particularly jazz, and has made numerous short abstract works in which the images are created in synchronization to a music track. While most of his films are exuberantly colored, Me Me Ma Ma (2000) is done in spare black and white. White scratches resembling rubbings, chalk drawings or electronic static jitter across a black background, matched to the driving beat of a techno music piece. Bru Ha Ha! (2002) takes a piece by Erik Satie and translates it into abstract imagery. The deep, masculine sound of a tuba appears in blocky shapes of colour, contrasted with delicate white squiggles corresponding to a woman singing. The tuba and voice play off each other as if in conversation, male and female. Dave Brubeck’s jazz classic “Take Five” is the inspiration for Cameras Take Five (2002), in which fluid lines represent the saxophone voice, moving over top of color fields of electric blue and green interspersed with playful shapes and doodles. These are vibrant, light-hearted works, which capture the spirit and energy of the music. As in jazz, improvisation and chance are important aspects of Woloshen’s work. Because his films are self-funded and the tools of his craft (film leader, markers, inks, brushes and craft knives) are readily available, he can seize on an inspiration and act on it immediately. He writes: “I think spontaneous urges and desires are the best part of handmade film making.” Woloshen even constructed a portable scratch box so that he could do scratch animation during breaks on his job as a driver in the feature film industry. As fun as Woloshen’s musical salutes are, for me the strongest and most satisfying of his films are those which depart somewhat from this method, such as The Babble on Palms (2001) and Two Eastern Hair Lines (2004). The Babble on Palms features various found-footage scenes of everyday life, accompanied by music by Ali Akbar Khan. The outline of a hand appears over all of the scenes, partially blocking our view. The hand is treated with constantly changing decoration such as dots and spirals, and patterns and colours reminiscent of both the solar system and cells under a microscope – the universe is contained in our hand. The film suggests a thread connecting all people, but also the limitations of our viewpoint and the individuality (the “hand print”) that sets us apart. Two Eastern Hair Lines also employs found footage, and is composed primarily of scenes of two or three people – a man and woman in a room together, two men seated across a desk from one another, a couple seated side-by-side. Parts of the images are framed, blocked out, or painted over, dividing and isolating the figures from each other. Set against a 1939 Chinese recording, “Parting at Yang Kwan,” Two Eastern Hair Lines is full of longing. It reflects on the unbridgeable distance between people and the difficulties of communication. As Woloshen writes in his description, “Sometimes the rifts between us are as wide as rivers, and sometimes as small as hair lines.” Woloshen was recently the subject of a retrospective screening at Saw Video Gallery, hosted by the Canadian Film Institute He is also featured in a new anthology on animation, The Sharpest Point: Animation at the End of Cinema, edited by Chris Gehman and Steve Reinke and co-published by YYZ Books, the Ottawa Animation Festival and the Images Festival. Since his return to filmmaking in 1996, after a hiatus of more than a decade spent working in various capacities in the film industry, Steven Woloshen has been extraordinarily productive, seemingly increasing his output year by year even as he faces the usual obstacles that tend to slow an independent filmmaker’s career (parenthood, the need to earn a living, lack of financing). It’s clear that the years he spent working on film sets and in labs were far from wasted: Woloshen’s work “post-hiatus” is extraordinarily assured compared to his promising films from the 80s, showing enormous progress in aesthetics, graphic technique and understanding of lab processes. (Most of his work now is in 35mm, and often in CinemaScope, an unusual format for this kind of animation.) Since 1999’s Get Happy, it seems, Woloshen has found his rhythm and his method. And happily, following the huge festival success of Ditty Dot Comma (2001) and a subsequent retrospective at the 2002 Ottawa International Animation Festival, his work has been increasingly seen and recognized at festivals, cinematheques and other venues around the world. His film, Cameras Take Five, was included in the Animation Show of Shows.

Horowitz was born in Montreal, Quebec on December 27, 1932. He attended the School for Teachers at McGill University and received his BA at Sir George Williams College in 1956. He earned a Master of Education from the University of Alberta in 1959 and a Doctor of Education from Stanford University in 1965. Horowitz taught for eight years in Montreal before accepting a position as a professor in the Faculty of Education at McGill University. He left McGill in 1969 to Alberta, where he accepted a position of Chair of the University of Alberta's Department of Elementary Education. He would later go on to serve various other academic positions in the University of Alberta: Dean of the Faculty of Education (1972–1975) and Vice-President (Academic) (1975–1979). Horowitz became the ninth president of the University of Alberta on August 1, 1979, succeeding Harry Gunning. He became known for his advocation for widely accessible early childhood services - something that he continued to fight for after his retirement as president in 1989, fighting against the Alberta government's decision to reduce funding for kindergartens. He was succeeded as president by Paul Davenport. He became the Professor Emeritus of Education in 1989 and President Emeritus in 1999 in the U of A. He moved to Victoria, British Columbia in 1998 and became the adjunct professor of Education at the University of Victoria. He is currently a member of the faculty involved with the University of Victoria's Centre for Youth and Society and Centre for Early Childhood Research and Policy. Horowitz was made an officer of the Order of Canada in 1990, and has received nine honorary doctrate degrees. The Myer Horowitz Theatre on the University of Alberta Campus is named in his honour.

Born in Montreal, Quebec, he was a member of the Ottawa RCAF Flyers who won the gold medal in ice hockey for Canada at the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz. Gilpin played Junior A hockey in Montreal. He joined the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), and in March 1947 he was transferred to the RCAF station in the “hockey crazy” town of Whitehorse, Yukon. The 1948 Winter Olympics were to be held in St. Moritz, Switzerland. They were then officially known as the V Olympic Winter Games as they were the first Olympic games to be celebrated after World War II. In the fall of 1947, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association invited the RCAF to form Canada’s Olympic ice hockey squad, and in January 1948 Gilpin was selected to be a member of Canada men's national ice hockey team – the Ottawa RCAF Flyers. Although Gilpin traveled to St. Moritz as a member of Canada national hockey team, due to tournament rules that allowed teams to dress only twelve players, Gilpin was used as a reserve and did not get into game play during the 1948 Olympics. Nonetheless, Gilpin was a member of the team that won Canada’s first gold medal in Olympic hockey since 1932, and he was given an Olympic Gold Medal. After the Olympic Games, the Ottawa RCAF Flyers went on an extensive exhibition tour of Europe, playing in front of crowds reaching 20,000 (as they did in Paris). The RCAF Flyers won 31 of the 42 post-Olympic games played. Upon returning to Canada with a gold medal around his neck, Gilpin and the other team members were greeted with a ticker-tape parade in Ottawa. During the 1948–49 season, Gilpin played for the RCAF Flyers in the Whitehorse Senior Men’s League. He died in 2014 at the age of 93.

The two were successful in receiving donations from both the Byzantines and Serbs, and refurbishing the monastery with revenue from Serbian silver and gold mines, making it one of the major Serbian monasteries.

Archibald was born in Montreal, Quebec, and received his initial education in Grenoble, France. Upon returning to Canada, he attended McGill University, receiving his Doctor of Medicine there in 1896. Archibald became interested in the specialist field of surgery, and began an apprenticeship at Royal Victoria Hospital. After a year in Europe studying under two well known physicians, the young surgeon was appointed to the staff of the Royal Victoria Hospital's Department of Surgical Pathology. However, Archibald became ill with tuberculosis, and moved to New York for treatment. Upon his recovery, the surgeon returned to Royal Victoria Hospital. There, he developed what he had learned in Europe, and came to be dubbed Canada's first neurosurgeon. In 1908, Archibald published a monograph, Surgical Affection and Wounds of the Head, but left neuroscience to combat the public health issue of tuberculosis. During World War I, the surgeon served in France as a military hospital doctor, and upon his return to Canada attempted to develop Canada's standard of education for surgeons, which he saw as declining. In 1935, Archibald became President of the American Surgical Association, and delivered a speech that is considered to have been the trigger for reforms of the standard of surgeon education in the United States. Archibald died on December 17, 1945 in Montreal. During his 73-year life, the surgeon had several medals, fellowships and even an honorary doctorate bestowed upon him.

Born into an evangelical Presbyterian newspaper family, Dougall’s liberal views often conflicted with her religious upbringing. Although born in Montreal, Quebec, she was educated in New York City and at both the University of Edinburgh and St. Andrew’s University in Scotland. While in Edinburgh, she lived with her aunt. She lived in Montreal from 1897 to 1903 until she finally settled down in Cumnor, near Oxford, in 1911. While there, she lived her life with her lesbian partner, Sophie Earp. In Cumnor, she became the center of a group that was dedicated to thought and conversation. This was similar in its views to that of her first essay, Pro Christo et Ecclesia (1900). Her debut novel, Beggars All, was published in 1892 followed by nine other novels. Her contemporaries thought her novels were "well-received" and they have "been widely read far from the shores of her native land". She also did write a novel prior to Beggars All, Lovereen, A Canadian Novel, that was published under a male pseudonym. She also published one volume of short stories and eight books of religious philosophy. Four of Dougall’s novels have Canadian settings spanning from western British Columbia to Eastern Quebec to Atlantic Prince Edward Island. What Necessity Knows, The Zeitgeist, The Mermaid: A Love Tale and The Madonna of a Day: A Study. Her fiction is characterized by twists of fate, disguise, hidden identity and disillusioned love. More noteworthy, however, her work is known for its exploration of religious and philosophical themes. Many of her protagonists are strong, independent females who are typically drawn to the idea of egalitarian marriage.

Born Cairine Reay Mackay in Montreal, she was the daughter of Jane Mackay and Robert Mackay, a Liberal Senator and personal friend of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. In 1909, she married Norman Wilson, the Liberal Member of Parliament for Russell and they moved to Cumberland, Ontario to begin a family. In 1918, the Wilsons moved to Ottawa, where Cairine performed extensive volunteer work. She helped found the Twentieth Century Liberal Association and the National Federation of Liberal Women of Canada, of which she was President from 1938 to 1948. Wilson was appointed the first female senator of the country at the age of 45 in February 1930 by the government of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, just four months after the Persons Case judgment was handed down by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Previously, women had not been allowed to serve in the Senate as lower courts had ruled they were not full "persons" under the law. As president of the League of Nations Society of Canada in 1938, Senator Wilson spoke out against the Munich Agreement's appeasement of Hitler. During the Second World War, the government of William Lyon Mackenzie King was resistant to permitting Jewish refugees from Germany to settle in Canada, but she was able to arrange the acceptance of 100 orphans. In 1949, at the request of King's successor Louis St. Laurent, Wilson became Canada's first female delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. She was the chairman of the Canadian National Committee on Refugees and the first woman to chair Senate Standing Committee (Immigration and Labour). She was given the Cross of the Knight of the Legion of Honour by France in 1950 for her work with child refugees. Wilson again made parliamentary history in 1955 when she became the first woman Deputy Speaker of the Canadian Senate. Her husband Norman, who had been in failing health for some time, died on July 14, 1956; they were the parents of eight children. Cairine Wilson died suddenly of a heart attack on Saturday, March 3, 1962. A secondary school in Orleans, Ontario is named for Wilson.

Tremblay's first professionally produced play, Les Belles-Sœurs, was written in 1965 and premiered at the Théâtre du Rideau Vert on August 28, 1968. It transformed the old guard of Canadian theatre and introduced joual to the mainstream.

Macnaughton was born in Greater Napanee, Ontario, and educated at Upper Canada College. He studied law at McGill University and began a law practice in Montreal where he served as a Crown Attorney from 1933 to 1942. Macnaughton first won a seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1949 election when he was returned as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Mount Royal. Macnaughton served as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee after the 1958 election, and his performance in that position led to the newly elected Liberal government nominating him for the position of Speaker following the 1963 election. Macnaughton presided over a House of Commons led by a minority government in which no party had control of the House, resulting in long and bitter debates that made it a challenge for any Speaker to maintain order. Acrimonious debates included that over the adoption of a new Canadian flag as well as the Munsinger Affair and other scandals. As Speaker, he attempted to bring in procedural reforms to make Parliament more efficient. He established four subcommittees of the Special Committee on Procedure and Organization, each chaired by a member of a different political party. The result of this process were recommendations for new procedures of time allocation in debates, a new committee structure, the abolition of the right to appeal rulings of the Speaker, research budgets for members and other changes most of which were ultimately implemented. During the Flag Debate, Macnaugton set a precedent by allowing the motion to be split into two and allowing separate motions on making the Maple Leaf the new flag and using the Union Flag as a symbol of Canada's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations. This was the first time a Speaker took it upon his own authority to split a motion. Macnaughton did so in the hope of facilitating debate and calming the House. Late in his term as Speaker, he served as a production consultant on the politically-themed CBC Television drama series Quentin Durgens, M.P.. Macnaughton did not contest the 1965 election, and retired from electoral politics. He was succeeded as MP for Mount Royal by Pierre Trudeau. In 1966, Macnaughton was appointed to a seat in the Canadian Senate by Lester B. Pearson, and served in that body until his retirement in 1978. In 1994, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1967, MacNaughton founded World Wildlife Fund Canada (WWF-Canada), which is the Canadian branch of the global conservation organization, World Wide Fund for Nature (formerly named World Wildlife Fund).

Widely regarded as one of the greatest Europeans ever to grace the game, he marked his era by being the most versatile player in the EuroLeague, serving as an inspiration to a whole generation of young European stars. At the age of fourteen, Diamantidis started his youth career with his home team in Kastoria. Five years later, he made his professional debut with Iraklis, and by 2003, he had emerged as an all-around star in the Greek League. He became a member of Panathinaikos in the summer of 2004, with whom he won three EuroLeague titles, in 2007, 2009, and 2011. Diamantidis' numerous accolades in the premier European competition include a EuroLeague MVP Award, two EuroLeague Final Four MVP Awards, four All-EuroLeague First Team selections, as well as a record six EuroLeague Best Defender Awards. He is the only player to have earned all four aforementioned EuroLeague end-of-season distinctions, even more so in a single year. Diamantidis was voted to the EuroLeague 2001–10 All-Decade Team, and is the EuroLeague all-time leader in assists and steals since the dawn of the Euroleague Basketball Company era in 2000. On April 1, 2016, he was honored with a EuroLeague Basketball Legend Award. Amidst a long series of riveting "derbies of the eternal enemies" opposing Panathinaikos and Olympiacos, Diamantidis arguably thrived as no other player in history. With Greek basketball's landscape being dominated by the two arch-rivals, he faced Olympiacos every year, for twelve consecutive seasons in countless crucial encounters, including eleven Greek League Finals, six Greek Cup Finals, and a EuroLeague semifinal. His nine Greek League and ten Greek Cup titles, alongside six Greek League Finals MVP awards, and two Greek Cup MVP awards, demonstrate the level of his unparalleled success. It was, however, beyond anything else, Diamantidis' well acknowledged calm, self-effacing psyche that had the most profound impact on a rivalry full of abuse on both sides. He especially contributed to a relief of tension between the two powerhouses, when he bowed out of professional basketball in 2016. As a member of the Greek national team, Diamantidis won a EuroBasket title in 2005; anchoring a defense that allowed 59.7 points per game. He scored the three-pointer that sealed the fate of the semifinal against France, seconds before the buzzer. His multidimensional contribution was highlighted, as he led the tournament in assists, and was part of the All-EuroBasket Team. In 2006, he played a pivotal role in a FIBA World Cup silver medal campaign, with Greece stunning Team USA in the semifinal, and Diamantidis finishing as the competition's steals leader. Diamantidis was a two-time Olympian, bearing the Greek colours in 2004 and 2008, and earning on both occasions, the fifth place of the tournament, tied as an all-time best finish for Greece. On the basis of his myriad achievements, he was named Mister Europa Player of the Year by Italian sports magazine Superbasket in 2007.

From 1960 to 1968, Aquin was active in the movement for Quebec independence. He was an executive member of the first independentist political party, the Rassemblement pour l'indépendance nationale (1960–1969). In 1964, he announced that he was going "underground" to work for independence through terrorism; he was arrested shortly thereafter and detained for four months in a psychiatric hospital. It was there that he wrote his first novel, Prochain épisode (1965), the story of an imprisoned revolutionary. In December 1964, he was acquitted of illegal possession of a firearm. Regarded as a classic of Canadian literature, Aquin's novel Next Episode (the English translation of Prochain épisode by Sheila Fischman), was chosen for the 2003 edition of CBC Radio's Canada Reads competition, where it was championed by journalist Denise Bombardier. It was the winning title. An earlier English translation by Penny Williams, keeping the French title, was published in 1967. The self-destructive thoughts of the novel's narrator foreshadow Aquin's own death: On 15 March 1977, Aquin shot himself in the head. He left a suicide note claiming his death was a free and positive choice, stating, "I have lived intensely, and now it is over."  A fuller understanding of Aquin's intense life can be gained from Jacques Godbout's biographical documentary, Deux épisodes dans la vie d'Hubert Aquin (1979) and from HA!: A Self-Murder Mystery (2003), an experiment in biography by Aquin's friend Gordon Sheppard.

Luc Plamondon, a French-Canadian lyricist, was inspired to write a hymn in Huguette Gaulin Bergeron’s honour. The hymn, entitled Hymne A La Beauté Du Monde, has since been sung by numerous French-Canadian artists such as Diane Dufresne, Isabelle Boulay, Garou, and Éric Lapointe.
