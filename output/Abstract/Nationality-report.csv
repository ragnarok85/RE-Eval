Sadat was a senior member of the Free Officers who overthrew King Farouk in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, and a close confidant of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, under whom he served as Vice President twice and whom he succeeded as President in 1970. In his eleven years as president, he changed Egypt's trajectory, departing from many of the political and economic tenets of Nasserism, re-instituting a multi-party system, and launching the Infitah economic policy. As President, he led Egypt in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 to regain Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, which Israel had occupied since the Six-Day War of 1967, making him a hero in Egypt and, for a time, the wider Arab World. Afterwards, he engaged in negotiations with Israel, culminating in the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty; this won him and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin the Nobel Peace Prize, making Sadat the first Muslim Nobel laureate. Though reaction to the treaty—which resulted in the return of Sinai to Egypt—was generally favorable among Egyptians, it was rejected by the country's Muslim Brotherhood and leftists in particular, who felt Sadat had abandoned efforts to ensure a Palestinian state. With the exception of Sudan, the Arab world and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) strongly opposed Sadat's efforts to make a separate peace with Israel without prior consultations with the Arab states. His refusal to reconcile with them over the Palestinian issue resulted in Egypt being suspended from the Arab League from 1979 to 1989. The peace treaty was also one of the primary factors that led to his assassination.

He was the third Vice President of the United States (1801–1805), serving during President Thomas Jefferson's first term. Burr served as a Continental Army officer in the Revolutionary War, after which he became a successful lawyer and politician. He was elected twice to the New York State Assembly (1784–1785, 1798–1799), was appointed New York state attorney general (1789–1791), was chosen as a United States senator (1791–1797) from the state of New York, and reached the apex of his career as vice president. The highlight of Burr's tenure as president of the senate (one of his few official duties as vice president) was the Senate's first impeachment trial, that of Supreme Court justice Samuel Chase. In 1804, the last full year of his single term as vice president, Burr killed his political rival Alexander Hamilton in a famous duel—a man whom he had rescued during the Revolutionary War. Burr was never tried for the illegal duel, and all charges against him were eventually dropped, but Hamilton's death ended Burr's political career. After leaving Washington, Burr traveled west seeking new opportunities, both economic and political. His activities eventually led to his arrest on charges of treason in 1807. The subsequent trial resulted in acquittal, but Burr's western schemes left him with large debts and few influential friends. In a final quest for grand opportunities, he left the United States for Europe. He remained overseas until 1812, when he returned to the United States to practice law in New York City. There he spent the rest of his life in relative obscurity.

He is sometimes known as the father of modern scientific animal breeding. Lush received National Medal of Science in 1968 and the Wolf Prize in 1979. Lush was introduced to mathematics and genetics during his B.Sc. studies of animal husbandry at the Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University). He completed his M.Sc. in 1918 at Kansas State, and his Ph.D. in genetics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1922). Lush advocated breeding not based on subjective appearance of the animal, but on quantitative statistics and genetic information. Lush authored a classic book 'Animal Breeding Plans' in 1937 which greatly influenced animal breeding around the world. From 1930 to 1966, Lush was the Charles F. Curtiss Distinguished Professor in Agriculture at Iowa State University. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1967.

In his late fifties, after becoming a frequent guest on the a Tonight Show hosted by Jack Paar, King emerged as an incongruous presence in the realm of national celebrity: an aging, irascible raconteur, with elegant mannerisms and trademark bow-tie, who spoke frankly and disarmingly about his bohemian lifestyle, multiple marriages, and years-long struggle with drug addiction. His checkered past led TIME magazine to describe him as "an ex-illustrator, ex-cartoonist, ex-adman, ex-editor, ex-playwright, ex-dope addict. For a quarter-century he was an ex-painter, and by his own bizarre account qualifies as an ex-midwife. He is also an ex-husband to three wives and an ex-Viennese of sufficient age (60) to remember muttonchopped Emperor Franz Joseph. When doctors told him a few years ago that he might soon be an ex-patient (two strokes, serious kidney disease, peptic ulcer, high blood pressure), he sat down to tell gay stories of the life of all these earlier Kings." He was also the author of several books, including May This House Be Safe from Tigers, Mine Enemy Grows Older, (an account of his addiction to morphine, and his recovery), and I Should Have Kissed Her More, Is There Life After Birth. He illustrated and/or translated numerous editions of classics in the early 20th century as well as a book by Peter Altenberg released as Alexander King Presents Peter Altenberg's Evocations of Love (a collection of sweet memories of the heart from another place and time in history).

Green later became the third Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives from 1792 to 1800, the eighth (and highly unpopular, due to what many students saw as his heavy-handed leadership style) President of Princeton University, from 1812 to 1822, and the second President of the Bible Society at Philadelphia (now known as the Pennsylvania Bible Society) after having been one its founding members in 1808.

In 2012, the St. Martin Parish precincts will be removed from District 39. Badon graduated in 1968 from Northside High School in Lafayette. Prior to his legislative tenure, Badon was a two-term member of the Carencro City Council in Lafayette Parish. He is a veteran of the United States Navy. Badon is Roman Catholic. In 2007, he defeated the Republican candidate, Raymond "La La" Lalonde, a former Democratic member of the Louisiana House. In the low-turnout general election held on November 17, 2007, Badon polled 3,914 (52 percent) to Lalonde's 3,662 (48 percent). Badon attributed crossover Republican voters who helped to secure his Democratic victory. He vowed to end corrupt practices in Louisiana state government: "I have not sold my vote to any special interest group. When I get to Baton Rouge, I don't owe anyone any favors," he told the Lafayette Daily Advertiser. In the October 20 nonpartisan blanket primary Lalonde had led Badon, 4,352 (30 percent) to 4,028 (27 percent). Two other primary candidates, both Democrats, held a combined and critical 43 percent of the vote. Incumbent Clara Baudoin was term-limited and hence ineligible to seek a fourth term. Badon served on these House committees: (1) Agriculture, Forestry, Aquaculture, and Rural Development, (2) Commerce, and (3) Natural Resources and Environment. In 2010, Badon was ranked 94 percent by the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry and 67 percent by the Louisiana Family Forum. In 2009, he was given 100 percent ranking by the Louisiana Right to Life Federation. On January 18, 2010, Badon was arrested in Carencro for driving while intoxicated after a Louisiana trooper stopped him for alleged improper lane usage. In June 2011, a state district court judge, Herman Clause, threw out the first-offense DWI case on grounds that the officer had no grounds to have stopped Badon. On August 2, 2011, Badon announced that because of his farming and business commitments he would not seek reelection in the October 22 nonpartisan blanket primary. Home builder Stephen Ortego, a Democrat who polled 25 percent of the ballots in the 2007 primary against Badon, ran again for the post in redistricted territory. The redrawn district will include Scott, now in District 45 represented by Speaker Pro Tempore Joel Robideaux of Lafayette, and southern St. Landry Parish. Primary results place Ortego in the November 19, 2011, general election with Republican Don Menard, who led the three-candidate field with 44.5 percent. Ortego trailed with 35 percent, and the Independent candidate, James "Jaime" Arnaud, held the remaining 20.5 percent of the ballots cast. Menard carries the backing of U.S. Senator David Vitter's Louisiana Committee for a Republican Majority. Stephen Ortego then won the general election with 55 percent of the vote.

Fortuyn provoked controversy with his outspoken views about multiculturalism, immigration and Islam in the Netherlands. He called Islam "a backward culture", and was quoted as saying that if it were legally possible, he would close the borders for Muslim immigrants. He was labelled a far-right populist by his opponents and in the media, but he fiercely rejected this label. Fortuyn was openly homosexual. Fortuyn explicitly distanced himself from "far-right" politicians such as the Belgian Filip Dewinter, the Austrian Jörg Haider, or Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Pen whenever compared to them. While he compared his own politics to centre-right politicians such as Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, he also admired former Dutch Prime Minister Joop den Uyl, a social democrat, and Democratic U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Fortuyn also criticised the Polder model and the policies of the outgoing government of Wim Kok and repeatedly described himself and LPF's ideology as pragmatic and not populistic. Fortuyn was assassinated during the 2002 Dutch national election campaign by Volkert van der Graaf. In court at his trial, van der Graaf said he murdered Fortuyn to stop him from exploiting Muslims as "scapegoats" and targeting "the weak members of society" in seeking political power.

After the war, he was convicted of war crimes and executed. A Romanian Army career officer who made his name during the 1907 peasants' revolt and the World War I Romanian Campaign, the antisemitic Antonescu sympathized with the far right and fascist National Christian and Iron Guard groups for much of the interwar period. He was a military attaché to France and later Chief of the General Staff, briefly serving as Defense Minister in the National Christian cabinet of Octavian Goga. During the late 1930s, his political stance brought him into conflict with King Carol II and led to his detainment. Antonescu nevertheless rose to political prominence during the political crisis of 1940, and established the National Legionary State, an uneasy partnership with the Iron Guard's leader Horia Sima. After entering Romania into an alliance with Nazi Germany and the Axis and ensuring Adolf Hitler's confidence, he eliminated the Guard during the Legionary Rebellion of 1941. In addition to leadership of the executive, he assumed the offices of Foreign Affairs and Defense Minister. Soon after Romania joined the Axis in Operation Barbarossa, recovering Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Antonescu also became Marshal of Romania. An atypical figure among Holocaust perpetrators, Antonescu enforced policies independently responsible for the deaths of as many as 400,000 people, most of them Bessarabian, Ukrainian and Romanian Jews, as well as Romanian Romani. The regime's complicity in the Holocaust combined pogroms and mass murders such as the Odessa massacre with ethnic cleansing, systematic deportations to occupied Transnistria and widespread criminal negligence. The system in place was nevertheless characterized by singular inconsistencies, prioritizing plunder over killing, showing leniency toward most Jews in the Old Kingdom, and ultimately refusing to adopt the Final Solution as applied throughout Nazi-occupied Europe. Confronted with heavy losses on the Eastern Front, Antonescu embarked on inconclusive negotiations with the Allies, just before a political coalition, formed around the young monarch Michael I, toppled him during the August 23, 1944, Coup. After a brief detention in the Soviet Union, the deposed Conducător was handed back to Romania, where he was tried by a special People's Tribunal and executed. This was part of a series of trials that also passed sentences on his various associates, as well as his wife Maria. The judicial procedures earned much criticism for responding to the Romanian Communist Party's ideological priorities, a matter that fueled nationalist and far right attempts to have Antonescu posthumously exonerated. While these groups elevated Antonescu to the status of hero, his involvement in the Holocaust was officially reasserted and condemned following the 2003 Wiesel Commission report.

After the war, he was convicted of war crimes and executed. A Romanian Army career officer who made his name during the 1907 peasants' revolt and the World War I Romanian Campaign, the antisemitic Antonescu sympathized with the far right and fascist National Christian and Iron Guard groups for much of the interwar period. He was a military attaché to France and later Chief of the General Staff, briefly serving as Defense Minister in the National Christian cabinet of Octavian Goga. During the late 1930s, his political stance brought him into conflict with King Carol II and led to his detainment. Antonescu nevertheless rose to political prominence during the political crisis of 1940, and established the National Legionary State, an uneasy partnership with the Iron Guard's leader Horia Sima. After entering Romania into an alliance with Nazi Germany and the Axis and ensuring Adolf Hitler's confidence, he eliminated the Guard during the Legionary Rebellion of 1941. In addition to leadership of the executive, he assumed the offices of Foreign Affairs and Defense Minister. Soon after Romania joined the Axis in Operation Barbarossa, recovering Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Antonescu also became Marshal of Romania. An atypical figure among Holocaust perpetrators, Antonescu enforced policies independently responsible for the deaths of as many as 400,000 people, most of them Bessarabian, Ukrainian and Romanian Jews, as well as Romanian Romani. The regime's complicity in the Holocaust combined pogroms and mass murders such as the Odessa massacre with ethnic cleansing, systematic deportations to occupied Transnistria and widespread criminal negligence. The system in place was nevertheless characterized by singular inconsistencies, prioritizing plunder over killing, showing leniency toward most Jews in the Old Kingdom, and ultimately refusing to adopt the Final Solution as applied throughout Nazi-occupied Europe. Confronted with heavy losses on the Eastern Front, Antonescu embarked on inconclusive negotiations with the Allies, just before a political coalition, formed around the young monarch Michael I, toppled him during the August 23, 1944, Coup. After a brief detention in the Soviet Union, the deposed Conducător was handed back to Romania, where he was tried by a special People's Tribunal and executed. This was part of a series of trials that also passed sentences on his various associates, as well as his wife Maria. The judicial procedures earned much criticism for responding to the Romanian Communist Party's ideological priorities, a matter that fueled nationalist and far right attempts to have Antonescu posthumously exonerated. While these groups elevated Antonescu to the status of hero, his involvement in the Holocaust was officially reasserted and condemned following the 2003 Wiesel Commission report.

He gained the rank of Captain in the Leicestershire Yeomanry and held the office of Justice of the Peace. The first English translation of Mein Kampf was an abridgment by Edgar Dugdale, who started work on it in 1931, at the prompting of his wife Blanche. When he learned that the London publishing firm of Hurst & Blackett had secured the rights to publish an abridgment in the United Kingdom, he offered it gratis in April 1933. However, a local Nazi party representative insisted that the translation be further abridged before publication, so it was held back from the public until 13 October 1933, although excerpts were allowed to run in The Times in late July. In America, Houghton Mifflin secured the rights to the Dugdale abridgment on 29 July 1933. The only differences between the American and British versions are that the title was translated as My Struggle in the UK and My Battle in America; and that Dugdale is credited as translator in the U.S. edition, while the British version withheld his name. Both Dugdales were active in the Zionist movement ; Blanche was the niece of Lord Balfour, and they wished to avoid publicity. In 1934, Dugdale published a biography of the British diplomat Maurice de Bunsen, who had died two years earlier.

Posadas' early studies were at the convent of San Francisco. Then he studied and practiced law with Manuel José de Labardén. In 1789 Posadas was appointed notary general for the bishopric, and held that post until the events of the May Revolution. He was unaware of the impending revolution and was caught by surprise when the Buenos Aires Cabildo (town hall) was occupied on 25 May 1810; he did not agree that it had been legitimately done. His donations to the Sociedad Patriótica made him an associate of the Saavedrist faction, so the leaders of the riots of 5 April 1811 exiled him to Mendoza. A month later he was appointed solicitor-procurator for the City of Buenos Aires. The Second Triumvirate commissioned Posadas, Nicolás Rodríguez Peña and Juan Larrea to draft a Constitution for consideration by the Asamblea del Año XIII, then he became part of the Triumvirate when the Assembly granted Executive Power to the Triumvirate. Then on 22 January 1814 the same Assembly decided to concentrate the Executive Power in him as a Supreme Director for the United Provinces, and so he took that office for a one-year period. During his rule, Saavedra and Campana were exiled, Montevideo fell to the United Provinces but serious problems arose with José Gervasio Artigas and the Liga Federal on the Banda Oriental. Moreover, Ferdinand VII of Spain regained his throne in 1815. Posadas was succeeded in office by his nephew, Carlos María de Alvear, who was removed soon afterwards by a military coup d'état. By August 1815 the whole Alvearista faction was in disgrace and Posadas was jailed. The former Supreme Director spent the next six years in 22 different jails. He began writing his memoirs in 1829.

For the surname, see Menem (surname).) Carlos Saúl Menem (born July 2, 1930) is an Argentine politician who was President of Argentina from 1989 to 1999. He has been a Senator for La Rioja Province since 2005. Born in Anillaco, he became a Peronist during a visit to Buenos Aires. He led the party in his home province of La Rioja, and was elected governor in 1973. He was deposed and detained during the 1976 Argentine coup d'état, and was elected governor again in 1983. He defeated the Buenos Aires governor Antonio Cafiero in the primary elections for the 1989 presidential elections, which he won. Hyperinflation forced outgoing president Raúl Alfonsín to resign early, shortening the presidential transition. Menem supported the Washington Consensus, and tackled inflation with the Convertibility plan in 1991. The plan was complemented by a series of privatizations, and was a success. Argentina re-established diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom, suspended since the 1982 Falklands War, and developed special relations with the United States. The country suffered two terrorist attacks. The Peronist victory in the 1993 midterm elections allowed him to force Alfonsín to sign the Pact of Olivos for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. This amendment allowed Menem to run for re-election in 1995, which he won. A new economic crisis began, and the opposing parties formed a political coalition that won the 1997 midterm elections and the 1999 presidential election. Menem ran for the presidency again in 2003, but unsure of winning against Néstor Kirchner, he resigned. He was elected senator for La Rioja in 2005.

Until 1917 he was one of the Scaddan government's main backbench critics, especially with regards to the 1916 Nevanas affair. In January 1917, he and Rufus Underwood attended a conference in Melbourne which aimed to merge Billy Hughes' National Labor Party with Joseph Cook's liberals. On 20 March, he resigned his Legislative Assembly seat in order to contest an Australian House of Representatives seat as a Nationalist. Shortly afterwards, the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party followed its federal counterpart's lead in expelling its pro-conscription members, including Heitmann. On 5 May 1917, Heitmann was elected to the Australian House of Representatives seat of Kalgoorlie. During the next two years he was in charge of transport arrangements for the demobilisation of the Australian Imperial Force. He was defeated in the federal election of 13 December 1919, and thereafter spent some time in Adelaide working in advertising. By 1921 he was farming at Laanecoorie, Victoria, and the following year contested the Victorian seat of Eaglehawk without success. In 1927 he returned to Bendigo, spending eighteen months as organisation secretary for the Advance Bendigo and the North League. In later life he suffered often from poor health, spending some time in the military hospital at Caulfield. He died at Bendigo on 30 January 1934, and was buried at Bendigo Cemetery.

Edward Heitmann was born in California Gully, Bendigo, Victoria on 3 June 1878. The son of carpenter and blacksmith Herman Heitmann and Katherine née Roberts, he was educated locally. He became a miner at an early age, eventually graduating to shaftsman before qualifying as a mine engine driver. In 1895 he moved to Western Australia but by the following year he had returned to Victoria, where took courses at the Bendigo School of Mines and Industries. On 29 June 1896 he married Emma Jane Johns; they would have a son and two daughters before her death in 1905. In 1909 he married Ada Maude Cooke, with whom he would have two sons and a daughter. In 1899, Heitmann returned to Western Australia to work on the Murchison goldfields. He became increasingly involved in the Labor movement, becoming president of the Day Dawn Engine Drivers' Association, and organising secretary of the Australian Workers' Union. On 24 June 1904 he was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seat of Cue on a Labor ticket. He held the seat until 4 November 1913, resigning it to contest the seat of Geraldton in a by-election.

Pauli's middle name was given in honor of his godfather, physicist Ernst Mach. Pauli's paternal grandparents were from prominent Jewish families of Prague; his great-grandfather was the Jewish publisher Wolf Pascheles. Pauli's father converted from Judaism to Roman Catholicism shortly before his marriage in 1899. Pauli's mother, Bertha Schütz, was raised in her own mother's Roman Catholic religion; her father was Jewish writer Friedrich Schütz. Pauli was raised as a Roman Catholic, although eventually he and his parents left the Church. He is considered to have been a deist and a mystic. Pauli attended the Döblinger-Gymnasium in Vienna, graduating with distinction in 1918. Only two months after graduation, he published his first paper, on Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. He attended the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, working under Arnold Sommerfeld, where he received his PhD in July 1921 for his thesis on the quantum theory of ionized diatomic hydrogen (H+2). Sommerfeld asked Pauli to review the theory of relativity for the Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften (Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences). Two months after receiving his doctorate, Pauli completed the article, which came to 237 pages. It was praised by Einstein; published as a monograph, it remains a standard reference on the subject to this day. Pauli spent a year at the University of Göttingen as the assistant to Max Born, and the following year at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen, which later became the Niels Bohr Institute in 1965. From 1923 to 1928, he was a lecturer at the University of Hamburg. During this period, Pauli was instrumental in the development of the modern theory of quantum mechanics. In particular, he formulated the exclusion principle and the theory of nonrelativistic spin. In 1928, he was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at ETH Zurich in Switzerland where he made significant scientific progress. He held visiting professorships at the University of Michigan in 1931, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1935. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1931. At the end of 1930, shortly after his postulation of the neutrino and immediately following his divorce in November, Pauli had a severe breakdown. He consulted psychiatrist and psychotherapist Carl Jung who, like Pauli, lived near Zurich. Jung immediately began interpreting Pauli's deeply archetypal dreams, and Pauli became one of the depth psychologist's best students. He soon began to criticize the epistemology of Jung's theory scientifically, and this contributed to a certain clarification of the latter's thoughts, especially about the concept of synchronicity. A great many of these discussions are documented in the Pauli/Jung letters, today published as Atom and Archetype. Jung's elaborate analysis of more than 400 of Pauli's dreams is documented in Psychology and Alchemy.

Jung's elaborate analysis of more than 400 of Pauli's dreams is documented in Psychology and Alchemy. The German annexation of Austria in 1938 made him a German citizen, which became a problem for him in 1939 after the outbreak of World War II. In 1940, he tried in vain to obtain Swiss citizenship, which would have allowed him to remain at the ETH. Pauli moved to the United States in 1940, where he was employed as a professor of theoretical physics at the Institute for Advanced Study. In 1946, after the war, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States and subsequently returned to Zurich, where he mostly remained for the rest of his life. In 1949, he was granted Swiss citizenship. In 1958, Pauli was awarded the Max Planck medal. In that same year, he fell ill with pancreatic cancer. When his last assistant, Charles Enz, visited him at the Rotkreuz hospital in Zurich, Pauli asked him: "Did you see the room number?" It was number 137. Throughout his life, Pauli had been preoccupied with the question of why the fine structure constant, a dimensionless fundamental constant, has a value nearly equal to 1/137. Pauli died in that room on 15 December 1958.

He received his early education from private tutors at Gunston Hall and was given Lexington plantation on Mason's Neck by his father in 1774. In 1775, he named his plantation to commemorate the Battle of Lexington in Massachusetts. Mason joined the Fairfax County Independent Militia in 1775 and was elected Ensign. He developed a rheumatic disorder that plagued him for the remainder of his life. In 1776, he commanded a militia company sent to Hampton, Virginia to protect the coast from Lord Dunmore's assaults, but was forced to quit the military on account of his increasingly poor health. He travelled to France between 1779 and 1783 for business purposes and to improve his health. At his father's request, George Washington wrote Mason letters of introduction to the marquis de Lafayette and Benjamin Franklin in Paris. While in France, he settled in Nantes, where he became involved in the tobacco trade and occasionally arranged for shipments of goods to his father. Upon the death of his father in 1792, Mason inherited the entirety of Mason's Neck. He died four years later at Lexington, on 5 December 1796, after suffering from chronic ill health for his entire adult life. He was interred in the Mason family graveyard at Gunston Hall.

His anti-trust and monetarist models influenced the Chicago school of economics. Simons is noted for a definition of economic income, developed in common with Robert M. Haig, known as the Haig–Simons equation; this definition of income has strongly influenced the modern American tax structure. In one of his better known essays, A Positive Program for Laissez Faire (1934) Simons set out a program of reform to bring private enterprise back to life during the Great Depression. Eliminate all forms of monopolistic market power, to include the breakup of large oligopolistic corporations and application of anti-trust laws to labor unions. A Federal incorporation law could be used to limit corporation size and where technology required giant firms for reasons of low cost production the Federal government should own and operate them... Promote economic stability by reform of the monetary system and establishment of stable rules for monetary policy... Reform the tax system and promote equity through income tax... Abolish all tariffs... Limit waste by restricting advertising and other wasteful merchandising practices. Henry Simons argued for changing the financial architecture of the United States to make monetary policy more effective and mitigate periodic cycles of inflation and deflation. The goal of changing the "monetary rules of the game" in this way was to "prevent… the affliction of extreme industrial fluctuations"—in other words, the business cycle.

After graduating Carroll studied bacteriology under Dr. William H. Welch at Johns Hopkins Hospital and assisted Walter Reed in pathology laboratories. Carroll and Reed later worked together at the Army Medical Museum in Washington and the Columbia University Medical School. In 1900 he served as an American physician and a member of the Yellow Fever Commission in Cuba, along with Walter Reed, Jesse William Lazear, and Aristides Agramonte. He and Lazear subjected themselves to the bite of infectious mosquitoes to test the theory that mosquitoes were carriers of yellow fever. Lazear died, but Carroll recovered and completed the last, official experiments of the Yellow Fever Commission. After a trip to Washington D.C., Carroll returned to Cuba for additional studies in which he proved that blood from active cases of yellow fever contained sub-microscopic infective agents. In 1904, with permission from Army Surgeon-General Robert Maitland O'Reilly, Carroll tested an oral typhoid fever vaccine on himself and 12 other volunteers from the military. Due to faulty vaccine preparation by lab personnel, seven men came down with the disease. They all survived, but the Office of the Surgeon General did not publicize the results.  The yellow fever infection Carroll contracted eventually killed him. Carroll was the inaugural president of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology.

He achieved a doctor's rank in philosophy on 3 January 1814, two days before turning eighteen. Three years later, on 26 April 1817, he was proclaimed summa cum laude doctor in civil law and in canonical law. Around 1817, King William I of the Netherlands enacted the creation of three universities in the southern provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands: in Ghent, in Liège and in Louvain (former Catholic University). As a consequence of the disturbances brought by the French revolution to teaching in these provinces, the personnel necessary for correct operation of these universities was missing. The government was obliged to search for staffing abroad and mainly in Germany. The thing was facilitated because lessons were to be given in Latin, so knowledge of the national languages was not required. The rector of the University of Würzburg, consulted by a Dutch diplomat, designated several candidates, including Jacques-Joseph Haus. A royal decree of 26 August 1817 named him professor in criminal law and in natural rights to the Ghent University.

His career, however, developed too quickly and too successfully for it to go unnoticed and unenvied. Contemporaries and historians have had differing opinions regarding Eggenberg's character: seeing him as a man ... who is successful at everything he does, a fellow of good fortune, with a reputation of being completely loyal to the Emperor, highly gifted and reliable, but also a corrupt and slippery customer. Both contemporaries and historians are, however, in agreement about his brilliant diplomatic talent, his personal charm and cleverness, and his extraordinary manner of dealing with people. Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg was born in June 1568 in Graz and had a Protestant upbringing. However, little is known about his childhood and youth. In 1583, he traveled to Tübingen, the heartland of German Protestantism, to study at the renowned Protestant university, Tübinger Stift, where he received a profound education. A famous associate of Hans Ulrich's, Johannes Kepler, also received a first-rate education at the Tübinger Stift and went on to write his first work, Mysterium Cosmographicum, while teaching in Graz. The intellectual dimensions of this education were to later form the basis of the complex programmatic orientations of his new residence, Schloss Eggenberg. After completing his studies, he embarked on the Grand Tour, a long educational journey undertaken by young noblemen of the period, which took him through the Netherlands, Spain, and Italy. After the death of his father in 1594, he returned to Graz to take over the safeguarding and administration of his estate and then soon began his career at the Court of Archduke Ferdinand in Graz. To be able to serve at court, he had had to convert to the Catholic faith and subsequently also supported the strict counter-reformatory policies of the Archduke. Hans Ulrich's influence became ever stronger at the Inner Austrian court due to interventions by the Archduchess Maria of Bavaria, Ferdinand's mother. Although ten years his senior, Eggenberg soon became Ferdinand's closest friend and confidant, a relationship that was to last all his life. Archduke Ferdinand was elected Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor of the German Nation in 1619. In his positions as the President of the Geheimrat (Privy Council) and Lord Chamberlain to his new Emperor, Hans Ulrich, the son of a merchant family from Graz, had risen to become one of the most significant and influential statesmen of his time during the period of the Thirty Years' War. Being something akin to a prime minister according to contemporary political understanding, it is said that between the years of 1619 to 1634, Ferdinand II never made one single significant political decision without seeking the advice of his friend Hans Ulrich, who remained loyal to him throughout the whole of this highly confusing and turbulent period and also throughout the rest of his life. The grateful Emperor rewarded his loyal adviser by bestowing on him the highest honors and ranks of the realm. In 1598, his cousin Ruprecht von Eggenberg and the entire Eggenberg family, including Hans Ulrich, were elevated into the Freiherrnstand (Baron's Estate). In 1620, King Philip III of Spain named Hans Ulrich a Knight of the Golden Fleece. In 1623, Hans Ulrich received a promotion into the Reichsfürstenstand, and the Eggenbergs were from then on of princely rank. By 1628, Hans Ulrich was also named Duke of Krumau. Hans Ulrich reached the pinnacle of his career in 1625 when he was made Gubernator (Governor) of Inner Austria. From this point on, he ruled "in the name of the Emperor" the Inner Austrian Patrimonial Lands with absolute power comparable only to an archduke in political, legal and military matters. He was the only non-Habsburg governor to have ever been awarded and exercised such a position. This office also prompted him to commission the conversion of the medieval family castle on the western edge of Graz into a new and glorious residence, Schloss Eggenberg, to appropriately represent his new status. Unfortunately, he died of severe gout in October 1634, before the palace was completed. Alongside his four daughters, Hans Ulrich also produced a male heir to the Eggenberg dynasty, Johann Anton I, who succeeded in attaining a position even his illustrious father had failed to attain: a seat among the princes of the empire in the Reichstag. As an imperial minister, Hans Ulrich had skilfully succeeded in guiding his master on the throne despite facing numerous dangers and constant upheavals during these times of great change. He slowly and consistently worked on his ideas of a united "empire", which he saw as a strengthened central imperial power, at the expense of the feudal interests of the old noble families and the desire for autonomy of the princes of the realm. This way, he became one of the major architects of the absolutist Habsburg state, which was to dominate and shape the century to come. In Austria, Hans Ulrich has left a historical legacy behind. His masterpiece, Schloss Eggenberg, was the main motif on one of the most famous silver collectors coins: the 10 euro Eggenberg Palace coin minted on 10 September 2002.

He graduated at Ludovica Military Academy. He was a military attaché in Prague from 1928 to 1934. On 5 August 1943 he succeeded vitéz Gusztáv Jány as commander of the Second Army. On 1 April 1944 he was appointed commander of the 1st Hungarian Army, but this was only until 15 May 1944. In August 1944 supporters of Lakatos and Horthy, armed with one tank, overthrew the German-installed government of Döme Sztójay. Lakatos's military government stopped the deportation of Hungarian Jews, with acting Interior Minister Béla Horváth ordering Hungarian gendarmes to use deadly force against any deportation effort. Lakatos also reopened peace talks with the Allies that had previously been begun by Miklós Kállay. He even went as far as to begin talks with the Soviets. On 15 October 1944, Horthy tried to force the Germans out entirely and concluded an armistice with the Allies. However, when Horthy announced this in a nationwide radio address, the Germans kidnapped Horthy's son, Miklós Horthy, Jr., and Horthy surrendered to them. The far right fringe Arrow Cross Party, backed by the Germans, immediately staged a coup and took full control of the government. Lakatos was forced to resign that day, and was imprisoned by the Germans in Sopronkőhida. After that he was interned into Sopron. Following the Soviet occupation of Hungary, Lakatos was interrogated several times in Kiskőrös. He was released from prison in January 1946 and thereafter appeared as a witness in war crime trials against the Arrow Cross Party and other pro-Nazi former officials before the so-called People's Tribunal of Budapest. In the forthcoming years he lived in his estate in Érd. His military pension was revoked by the Communist authorities and his lands were also confiscated in 1949. Following that he moved to Budapest where he worked as a book illustrator and silk painter, and lived in poor financial circumstances. His daughter emigrated to Australia in 1956, when the failed Hungarian Revolution briefly allowed people to emigrate from Hungary. Following his wife's death in 1965, the authorities permitted Lakatos to travel to Adelaide where his daughter lived since 1957. He died there two years later, in 1967.

Pedro de los Ríos was named governor of Castilla del Oro in May 1526 and took charge of the post in July of the same year. He later moved to Nicaragua and earned the trust of its administrators who also bestowed him the governorship. However, the governor of Honduras Diego López de Salcedo y Rodríguez soon arrived in León, Nicaragua, and obliged Ríos to abandon the post and return to Castilla del Oro. After several years of mishandling the governorship of Castilla del Oro, he was removed from the post and succeeded by Antonio de la Gama in August 1529. His duties done in Central America, he decided to join Francisco Pizarro in the newly discovered territory of Peru. Once there, he arrived in the Incan capital of Cuzco and was registered among its first Spanish settlers. Ríos sided with Pizarro's forces against initial unsuccessful attempts by the Spanish Crown to regain Peru. He participated in the Battle of Chupas (1542) and several years later died in combat at Huarinas, near Lake Titicaca on October 27, 1547.

He also led the Socialist Party of Serbia from its foundation in 1990. He rose to power as Serbian President after he and his supporters claimed the need to reform the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia due to both the alleged marginalization of Serbia and its political incapacity to deter Albanian separatist unrest in the province of Kosovo. His presidency of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was marked by several major reforms to Serbia's constitution in the 1980s to the 1990s that reduced the powers of the autonomous provinces in Serbia and in 1990 transitioned Serbia from a Marxist–Leninist one-party system to a multi-party system, attempted reforms to the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia, the breakup of Yugoslavia and the outbreak of the subsequent wars, the founding of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by the former SFRY republics of Serbia and Montenegro, negotiating the Dayton Agreement on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs that ended the Bosnian War in 1995, and his overthrow in 2000. In the midst of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Milošević was charged by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) with war crimes including genocide and crimes against humanity in connection to the wars in Bosnia, Croatia, and Kosovo. Milošević resigned the Yugoslav presidency amid demonstrations, following the disputed presidential election of 24 September 2000. He was arrested by Yugoslav federal authorities on 31 March 2001 on suspicion of corruption, abuse of power, and embezzlement. The initial investigation into Milošević faltered for lack of evidence, prompting the Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić to extradite him to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to stand trial for charges of war crimes instead. At the outset of the trial Milošević denounced the Tribunal as illegal because it had not been established with the consent of the United Nations General Assembly; therefore he refused to appoint counsel for his defence. Milošević conducted his own defence in the five-year-long trial, which ended without a verdict when he died in his prison cell in The Hague on 11 March 2006. Milošević, who suffered from heart ailments and hypertension, died of a heart attack. The Tribunal denied any responsibility for Milošević's death, and stated that he had refused to take prescribed medicines and medicated himself instead. In February 2007, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled separately in the Bosnian Genocide Case that there was no evidence linking Serbia and Milošević to genocide committed by Bosnian Serbs in the Bosnian war. However, the Court did findthat Milošević and others in Serbia had committed a breach of the Genocide Convention by failing to prevent the genocide from occurring and for not cooperating with the ICTY in punishing the perpetrators of the genocide, in particular General Ratko Mladić, and for violating its obligation to comply with the provisional measures ordered by the Court.

In 1928 Heller had a short time relationship with Elisabeth Langgässer. Their daughter, Cordelia, was born in 1929. In his short life, he was involved in a number of political debates and controversies, most notably with Hans Kelsen, Carl Schmitt and Max Adler. In short, Heller's theories are both a reinterpretation of Hegelian social theory and an emendation of Bernstein's revisionism. Heller calls for the integration of the working class in the social, cultural and political structures of the nation-state. Against Carl Schmitt he argued that it is not so much the state of emergency, but rather the state of social and political stability which defines the sovereign. He is generally perceived to have been a major influence on Carlo Schmid who, in turn, drafted most of the German Constitution and was the main force behind the reform of the SPD. Heller was forced to go into exile in 1933 and died in Madrid in the same year, leaving his Magnum Opus, the Staatslehre, unfinished. His collected works, in three volumes, have been published by the Mohr Verlag of Tübingen. Recently, there is a renewed interest in Heller's work, especially in Germany. Some of his work has been translated in English. His views have been influential in both Japan and the Spanish-speaking world.

He was a member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1922 to 1934, representing the electorate of Barker for the Liberal Party (1922-1925), Nationalist Party (1925-1931) and United Australia Party (1931-1934). Cameron was born at German Creek, where his father managed a pastoral property, and was educated at the Tantanoola school. He began farming at German Creek, before acquiring property at Glencoe when John Riddoch divided the former Glencoe Station. He was clerk of the District Council of Tantanoola for twenty years, president of the local progress association, president of the Glencoe branch of the Agricultural Bureau, vice-president of the Mount Gambier Agricultural and Horticultural Society, and one of the key figures in the construction of the district hall and a member of its committee. He was credited with much of the responsibility for the development of the Glencoe railway line. He was a prominent member of the Farmers and Producers Political Union and later served as president of the local branch of its successor, the Liberal Union. Cameron was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1922 federal election for the Liberal Party, a splinter group from the governing Nationalist Party. He had ousted the incumbent MP, John Livingston, in party preselection, after the party's Barker district committee voted to endorse him over Livingston without a plebiscite. In 1925, along with his colleagues, he formally rejoined the Nationalist Party, which in turn became the United Australia Party in 1931. He was re-elected at five successive elections, and served as a member of the Standing Committee on Public Works, including a stint as chairman. Cameron suffered a serious illness early in 1934, and though he initially recovered enough to be endorsed to stand again at the 1934 federal election, his illness recurred and he was forced to withdraw his candidacy in July and retire. He was confined to his bed for six months prior to his death in March 1935, and was buried at the Mount Gambier Cemetery.

She has been married to Paulo Coelho since 1980. Oiticica is known for using an exotic neoconcretist technique that reminds both the land art and the eco art - a technique that allows nature’s elements to act upon her works. Oiticica is a "daughter" of the experimental art movement of the 1970s arisen in Rio de Janeiro, where she was born, and has taken her paintings to all four corners of the world. Oiticica idealized the combination of land art – which uses nature as foundation matter – with a painting in the French Pyrenees, five years ago, when she decided to paint a 10-meter long canvas in the middle of nature in the open air, as she realized not to have a covered area that would enable her to create on such surface. Once her work was finished, she left it to dry right there, outside. On the next day, as she went back to pick it up, she found that dust, dirt, leaves and some insects had been integrated to the canvas. "With no premeditation, nature had given its unique touch to the painting." The artist began this technique painting in the forests, valleys and mountains of the Pyrenees, in France. The result of this work is her book The Four Seasons. Soon after, between 2004 and 2005 she buried many canvases in the Amazon Rainforest forest in Brazil and waited a year to retrieve them. The humid and equatorial forest left their indelible marks on her paintings. Also in 2005 she took her work up to the Sacred Valley of Ganespura, in India. Between 2006 and 2008, Oiticica elected the Saint James Way, a sacred and symbolic place that receives pilgrims from all over the world, as her studio. She composed her canvases at different locations along the Way, using the relief of rocks, the intervention of rain, snow, the color of the soil, natural pigments and wax. Once composed, they were "planted" on the ground and recovered months later. Generally, Oiticica leaves her canvases "planted" for a period of nine months (the cycle of a pregnancy) or for one year (cycle of the four seasons).

On the next day, as she went back to pick it up, she found that dust, dirt, leaves and some insects had been integrated to the canvas. "With no premeditation, nature had given its unique touch to the painting." The artist began this technique painting in the forests, valleys and mountains of the Pyrenees, in France. The result of this work is her book The Four Seasons. Soon after, between 2004 and 2005 she buried many canvases in the Amazon Rainforest forest in Brazil and waited a year to retrieve them. The humid and equatorial forest left their indelible marks on her paintings. Also in 2005 she took her work up to the Sacred Valley of Ganespura, in India. Between 2006 and 2008, Oiticica elected the Saint James Way, a sacred and symbolic place that receives pilgrims from all over the world, as her studio. She composed her canvases at different locations along the Way, using the relief of rocks, the intervention of rain, snow, the color of the soil, natural pigments and wax. Once composed, they were "planted" on the ground and recovered months later. Generally, Oiticica leaves her canvases "planted" for a period of nine months (the cycle of a pregnancy) or for one year (cycle of the four seasons).

On 6 March 2009, his home and offices in Berlin and Karlsruhe were raided by the LKAs of both Berlin and Baden-Württemberg in a search for child pornography which he had allegedly obtained on his mobile phone. Although he claimed that the raid and investigation were politically motivated, he resigned from all government posts on 7 March, and was stripped of his parliamentary immunity on the same day. Prosecutors began the investigation after they had obtained access to phone numbers and addresses found on the mobile phone of a Bremerhaven man who was suspected of participation in a child pornography ring. He stated on 11 March that he had purchased the material only for investigation purposes pertinent to his office. He reports that his research suggests that child pornography is typically distributed by MMS and traditional mail, so that blocking websites is ineffective.

The judge concluded that he had been active in the online child pornography scene for private reasons rather than out of political motives relating to his parliamentary work. However, the judge did not think his motivation had necessarily been sexual, it could have been sheer curiosity. 'This is a judgement which I cannot live with and do not want to live with,' Tauss said after the trial. He plans to appeal the verdict.

Range Bandarage Palitha Range Bandara was born on the 8th Sept, 1962 as the sixth child to a family of eleven children in the remote village of Karuwalagaswewa off Puttalam. Having completed his primary and secondary education at Ananda College Puttalam, he joined the Police Force to serve both his community and the country back in 1983. While working at Sri Lanka Police, he laid claim to an illustrious career which continued until 24 August 2000. Towards the latter part of his police career, he encountered a lot of politically motivated mistreatments due to his loyalty to the United National Party which in turn affected his ability to serve the people in his capacity as a police officer. This proved to be a vital juncture in his life where he decided that he no longer can serve the best interests of the people while facing these acts of political vengeances and decided to leave the police force. It was the year 2000, and although he had the opportunity to migrate to Australia with his family; he decided against it. Instead, he took the decision to join the political fray of the country and contest the general elections to represent his community in the parliament. Taking a stand against the injustices faced by his people, he was selected to Parliament for the first time at the general election held on the 10th of October 2000 being the third on the preferential list. He was an unquestionable leader to his people and rose to fame quickly in the district, and soon after in the 2001 General Election he topped the list of preferential votes. He has continued to enjoy an immense popularity amongst the voters and has since then sustained the leading position in the list of preferential votes and has been a Member of Parliament continuously. With the change of the ruling regime in the presidential election held on the 8th of January 2015, he was appointed the State Minister of Power and Energy, and has since rendered a massive service to the people of the Puttalam district as part of the 100-day government. As the State Minister of Power and Energy, Mr. Palitha Range Bandara has taken the initiative to provide more than 650 power line extensions under Rural Electrification Projects in the Puttalam district alone. Under his direction, 21 million rupees received from the Norocholai Coal Power Project to carry out community welfare service has been utilized to construct the ground and Pavilion at his alma mater Ananda College in Puttalam. Additionally, he has made use of the same funds to provide 450 motor bicycles to fishermen folk in the Norochcholai/Kalpitiya area and has intervened to provide 1200 families housing loans at low interest rates. As a minister he has furthermore provided Government employment opportunities to more than 450 youths

He was born in Hobson Street, Auckland. He passed most of his boyhood at the Thames, and after leaving school went to the Northern Wairoa district, where he took to a bushman's life. His work in the kauri bushes was varied by an occasional spell as a boatman on the river, and so he got his first lessons in rowing. For three years he was in the service of the Hon. E. Mitchelson, at Dargaville, and during that time got a good deal of rough practice in rowing. His first race was rowed, with J. Wilson as a partner, in the pairs at the Wairoa Regatta in April 1887. Their principal opponents were the Brothers Brown, who were recognised at the time as the "bosses" of the river. To the surprise of everyone young Stephenson and his mate won easily. The Browns were not satisfied with their defeat, and a match was made with their conquerors for £50 a-side, to come off a month after the regatta. This had the same result, and Stephenson's reputation began to grow. In January 1888, he was one of the Northern Wairoa Whaleboat Crew which finished third at Auckland Anniversary Regatta. Waitemata winning and North Shore rowing second. After this he went back to the bush; but in November 1888, he and two friends left the Wairoa, intending to go to Tasmania. Stephenson, however, got no further than Sydney, where he determined to try his luck as a professional sculler. The Spencer Brothers, who brought out Searle and Matterson, finding that he gave good promise, took him 'up' and backed him against Joe Kemp, brother of the ex-champion, for £100 a-side. The match was rowed over the Parramatta course on 30 August 1889, and resulted in a three lengths win for Stephenson, the time for the first mile being 5min 43sec, and the full distance being rowed in 20min 24.5sec. On 30 October 1889 Stephenson sustained a defeat by John McLean, who beat him by three lengths, after a good race, over the same course, in 21min 53sec. For this match Stephenson was backed by Mr Warby, of Sydney, who was his chief supporter for a match for the Championship of New Zealand. His opponent was William Hearn. Stephenson was thus, as compared with his opponent, a novice sculler but he won by three lengths in a time of 22min 22.75sec. The race was run in Wellington on 5 February 1890.Stephenson next defended his title against Tom Sullivan on the Parramatta River, Sydney on 11 May 1891. The stake was £100 a side. Stephenson was defeated by Sullivan. See also New Zealand Sculling Championship. Stephenson then travelled overseas. On 1 September 1892 he raced Ned Hanlan in a two miles race in Toronto, Canada and he (Stephenson) lost by two lengths.

He is also an attorney, a retired United States Navy officer (CAPT, O-6), and an elected official from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. From 2000 to 2005, Futrell served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from District 66 in East Baton Rouge Parish. He resigned a year into his second term to become the state director for freshman U.S. Senator David Vitter. Having followed Democrat-turned-Republican Woody Jenkins in the House, Futrell was himself succeeded by another Republican lawyer, Hunter Greene. Journalist John Maginnis said that Futrell did not stand out during his tenure in the legislature but was well-liked and well-regarded. Futrell's resume indicates that in 2002, he received the "Golden Apple Legislators Support of Education" award. In 2004, he obtained the Louisiana Municipal Association Leadership Award. In 2005, he procured the Louisiana Family Forum Legislative Advocate Award. Prior to the House tenure, Futrell was from 1997 to 2000 the District 8 member of the East Baton Rouge Parish Metro Council. He was elected without opposition in September 1996 to succeed the incumbent Republican member Lynda Imes, who instead ran for the Louisiana State Senate but lost to the Republican Jay Dardenne. Futrell was named as one of Baton Rouge Business Report's "40 Under 40" rising stars in Baton Rouge. In 2008, after leaving Vitter's staff, Futrell became the assistant chief administrative officer of the City of Baton Rouge, serving under Walter Monsour. In 2009, upon Monsour's retirement, Futrell was elevated to Chief Administrative Officer by Baton Rouge Mayor-President Kip Holden, a Democrat. A native of Baton Rouge, Futrell was reared in the Sherwood Forest subdivision. In 1978, he graduated from Baton Rouge High School. In 1982, he received his Bachelor of Business Administration from Louisiana State University. In 1985, he received the Juris Doctor degree from the LSU Paul M. Hebert Law Center. He is a U.S. Navy veteran and also a graduate of the Air Force Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. From 1987 to 1993, Commander Futrell served two tours of duty as an officer on nuclear submarines. On the USS Grant, near the end of the Cold War, Futrell came in constant contact with submarines of the former Soviet Union. The communists tracked the American vessels so that they could attack immediately if war were suddenly declared. The Americans tried to avoid attack to remain a nuclear deterrent against the Soviets. Futrell also served on the submarine, the USS Kentucky. Futrell said that he had considered becoming an attorney for the Judge Advocate General's office but instead entered a private firm in Baton Rouge. In 2006, while on Vitter's staff, Futrell was recalled to active duty for twelve months during the Iraq War. For that service, he won the Bronze Star. Futrell was assigned as Officer in Charge of DRMS operations in Iraq, leading installations at four U.S. bases in Iraq. He soon returned to Vitter's office to manage the D. C. Madam scandal. He resigned as Vitter's state director, not because of that controversy, but because he desired to return permanently to Baton Rouge, and the state directorship had required travel throughout the state to Vitter's seven district offices. In 2008, Futrell completed the leadership course offered by the interest group, the Council for a Better Louisiana. He then joined the Holden administration. Then CAO Walter Monsour said that Futrell immediately earned his trust through the handling of the city-parish $1.2 billion sewer program. Monsour describes Futrell as "a very smart person ... who had a great sense of when to say ‘yes, sir,’ when to say ‘no, sir,’ and when to step up and speak his mind, and I appreciated that. ..." In 2010 Futrell was again recalled to active duty, this time on the staff of U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii, serving as a Navy Captain. At U.S. Pacific Command, Futrell was Director of the Commander's Action Group (CAG) working directly with the Commander of U.S. Pacific Command. He also led a crisis action team responding to the earthquake in Japan. At the end of his one year tour of duty, Futrell stayed in Hawaii as Executive Vice President of Hawaii Gas, the natural gas utility company servicing the major islands in Hawaii. In 2014, Futrell relocated to South San Francisco to become the city's City Manager. He received his law degree from Louisiana State University Paul M. Herbert Law Center, holds a Master’s in Business Administration (MBA) from University of Massachusetts-Amherst and a bachelor’s in business and public administration from Louisiana State University.

He was professor in Kraków, Wrocław, and Królewiec (Königsberg). He was the inventor of new operating techniques and tools, and is one of the pioneers of antiseptics and aseptic techniques. In Poland	Jan Mikulicz-Radecki (German: Johann Freiherr von Mikulicz-Radecki) was a Polish-Austrian surgeon. He was born on 16 May 1850 in Czerniowce in the Austrian Empire (present-day Chernivtsi in Ukraine) and died on 4 June 1905 in Breslau, German Empire. He was professor in Kraków, Wrocław, and Królewiec (Königsberg). He was the inventor of new operating techniques and tools, and is one of the pioneers of antiseptics and aseptic techniques. In Poland he is regarded as one of the founders of the Kraków school of surgery. His parental ancestors of the Mikulicz family were of Polish szlachta origin and had been granted the Gozdawa coat of arms by King John III Sobieski after the 1683 Battle of Vienna. His mother Freiin von Damnitz was of Austrian descent. Mikulicz-Radecki spoke his native Polish, and also German, Russian and English fluently. When asked his nationality he used to answer "surgeon". After finishing studies at the University of Vienna under Theodor Billroth, he was a director of surgery at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, the University of Königsberg (Królewiec, Kaliningrad) and from 1890 at the University of Wrocław. Mikulicz-Radecki's innovations in operative technique for a wide variety of diseases helped develop modern surgery. He contributed prodigiously to cancer surgery, especially on organs of the digestive system. He was first to suture a perforated gastric ulcer (1885), surgically restore part of the oesophagus (1886), remove a malignant part of the colon (1903), and describe what is now known as Mikulicz’ disease. In 1881 he developed improved models of the esophagoscope and gastroscope. As an ardent advocate of antiseptics, he did much to popularize Joseph Lister's antiseptic methods. He created a surgical mask and was the first to use medical gloves during surgery. Mikulicz-Radecki was a talented amateur pianist and a friend of Johannes Brahms. He received an honorary doctorate (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901.

Iacobescu or Dumitru Iacobescu (Romanian pronunciation: [duˈmitru jakoˈbesku]; born Armand Iacobsohn; 1893 – October 9, 1913) was a Romanian Symbolist poet. His literary activity only lasted about two years, between his high school graduation and his death from tuberculosis, but made him a critically acclaimed presence inside Romania's Symbolist movement. Much of Iacobescu's work remained unpublished during his lifetime, and survived as autographed notebooks. Once rediscovered and published some twenty years after his death, it brought him posthumous recognition as a writer of talent, but one whose introversion and nostalgia ran contrary to the main currents in modernism. Romanticizing his own physical suffering while adopting stylistic elements from French Symbolist classics such as Paul Verlaine, D. Iacobescu left lyric poetry that is either resigned or visionary in dealing with mortality. His other contributions display an interest in Decadent, pre-modernist, themes, as well as a taste for black comedy. The contrast between his approach and that of other, more avant-garde, Romanian Symbolists did not prevent Iacobescu's affiliation with the modernist circle at Ion Minulescu's Insula magazine.

Later he was one of the founders of the Schweizerische Monatshefte für Politik und Kultur (SM) in 1921. This very quickly became the mouthpiece for the Popular League for the Independence of Switzerland, a group he had participated around the same time which opposed the League of Nations. He briefly met Adolf Hitler when Hitler visited Switzerland in 1923 and became an sympathizer of both Fascist Italy and Othmar Spann. Although the Popular League proved to be short-lived, Oehler continued to publish SM as an outlet for his political ideas until, in 1932, he joined the New Front. 1934 he had to resign as an editor of SM because of his pro-nazism mindset. With the launch of the National Front in 1934 Oehler took charge of editing the new party's paper Nationale Front, as well as being appointed foreign affairs spokesman. Ousted from SM by the Front he founded a new paper, Nationale Hefte and by 1938 had split from the Front altogether. After the split he joined with Rolf Henne in forming the hardline Nazi Bund Treuer Eidgenossen Nationalsozialistischer Weltanschauung, another minor group which was absorbed by the Nationale Bewegung der Schweiz in 1940. Oehler's profile fell as World War II neared its conclusion and he became very much a marginal figure in post-war Switzerland. Having attended a meeting in Munich in 1940 organised to bring together pro-Nazi Swiss leaders, Oehler was tried for treason by a federal court in 1957 and sentenced to two years in prison. Upon his release Oehler became a leading member of the Volkspartei der Schweiz and headed up the Swiss branch of Nation Europa, an international neo-Nazi journal. He also adopted the pseudonym Hans Rudolf to translate works into German, notably Nuremberg ou la Terre Promise of Maurice Bardèche, as well as writing for the far right journal Turmwart. Oehler continued his political activity until his death at Dielsdorf.

He began his career in the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in Vienne, and, by the time of World War I, was serving under Albert Thomas, the Minister of Armaments. A French Army Captain, he was Thomas' envoy to the Russian Republic, keeping contact with the socialist circles and steering them toward the Entente Powers. After the October Revolution, he maintained close contacts with the Bolsheviks, pledging them his support against the Central Powers during the crisis of 1917–1918. He was unable to prevent Bolshevist Russia from signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which took her out of the war, but, having established close contacts with Leon Trotsky and other communist leaders, became a communist himself. Opting not to return to France during the Russian Civil War, Sadoul co-founded the French Communist Group in Russia, fighting for control of it against Pierre Pascal and Henri Guilbeaux. Helping to set up the Red Army, he was sent to the Ukraine, where he instigated mutinies among the French intervention troops, and then to Germany, where he set up communist cells. Sadoul also mediated between the International and the SFIO's left-wing, attracting members for what became the French Communist Party (PCF), and contributed doctrinaire essays in L'Humanité. A French military court sentenced him to death in absentia, while the SFIO presented him, symbolically, as a candidate in the 1919 elections. Finally moving back to France in 1924, and acquitted upon retrial, Sadoul remained at the center of controversy. He joined the PCF, but failed to win any elections, and was generally marginalized by the party leadership. A Stalinist apologist and Izvestia correspondent in the 1930s, he helped the Soviet Union maintain contacts with the French establishment, and represented Soviet interests in France. He was pressured into collaborationism with Vichy France during World War II, but openly returned to communism in 1944, and ended his career in politics as mayor of Sainte-Maxime.

He is said to be Yemen's most famous arms-dealer. Mana'a was born on February 8, 1965 in the northern city of Sa'dah and was an ally of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and member of his ruling GPC party and served as head of his presidential committee and as head of a local council tasked with mediating a peace-deal between the Yemeni government and Houthis during the Shia insurgency in Yemen. His brother was the governor of Saada Governorate at the time. His name was put on a UN Security Council list of people accused of trafficking arms to Somali Islamist insurgent group Al-Shabaab, which is considered as a terrorist organisation by the United States and is accused of with al-Qaeda. This led to his assets being frozen by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. He was also accused of receiving millions in funds from the then Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi, spying for Libya and supplying arms to the Houthis. Mana'a denied these charges claiming that arms had been stolen by Houthis from an arms deposit he owned. In October 2009 was put at the top of a blacklist of Yemeni arms-dealers, after which he was put under surveillance. In late January 2010, Mana'a was arrested by Yemeni authorities leading to protests in Sa'dah by tribal chiefs and the resignation of his brother, Hassan Mana'a, as governor. In May, a mini-bus driver was killed and a policeman and a civilian woman were injured as a group of Manaa's men attacked the car in which he was being transported to a penal court. This resulted in his trial being delayed by 25 days. He was eventually released on June 4, after which his relations with President Saleh soured. On March 19, Houthis attacked the city of Sa'dah, starting a battle with pro-government al-Abdin tribesmen, led by Yemeni lawmaker Sheikh Othman Majali. During the battle, rebels joined forces with Fares Mana'a and after their victory, set up a local committee, composed of rebels, residents and defected military commanders, which appointed him as the new governor of Sa'dah on 26 March, after the pro-Saleh governor Taha Hajer fled to the capital Sana'a. He led the Houthis independent administration in Sa'dah governorate until December 2014.

Simeon Radev described him as the most European-like of all Bulgarian politicians. Born in Plovdiv, Stoilov studied at Robert College in Istanbul, before studying law at Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg to doctorate level. Whilst in Germany he became a Freemason. A career politician with the Conservative Party, and later his own People's Party, he held a number of government portfolios including Foreign Minister, Law Minister and Interior Affairs Minister. His first reign as Prime Minister lasted only for a brief spell in 1887. He returned in 1894 to preside over a longer ministry, which was characterized by increasing toleration for the activities of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization as well as fairer treatment of the Jews (as a lawyer, Stoilov had successfully defended the Jews of Vratsa from allegations of blood libel in 1890). Stoilov's government faced a campaign of criticism from sections of the press as organised by his main political opponent Stefan Stambolov and as a consequence the Stoilov administration enacted legislation against Stambolov, notably sequestering his land for state use and abolishing the pensions paid to former government ministers. The Stoilov-led coalition remained in office until 1899 when a series of liberal administrations began. He remained an important figure in Bulgarian politics until his death.

He was the elder brother of zoologist-professor Richard Hertwig (1850–1937).The Hertwig brothers were the most eminent scholars of Ernst Haeckel (and Carl Gegenbaur) from the University of Jena. They were independent of Haeckel's philosophical speculations but took his ideas in a positive way to widen their concepts in zoology. Initially, between 1879–1883, they performed embryological studies, especially on the theory of the coelom (1881), the fluid-filled body cavity. These problems were based on the phylogenetic theorems of Haeckel, i.e. the biogenic theory (German = biogenetisches Grundgesetz), and the "gastraea theory". Within 10 years, the two brothers moved apart to the north and south of Germany	Oscar Hertwig (21 April 1849 in Friedberg – 25 October 1922 in Berlin) was a German zoologist and professor, who also wrote about the theory of evolution circa 1916, over 55 years after Charles Darwin's book The Origin of Species.

Within 10 years, the two brothers moved apart to the north and south of Germany.Oscar Hertwig later became a professor of anatomy in 1888 in Berlin; however, Richard Hertwig had moved 3 years prior, becoming a professor of zoology in Munich from 1885–1925, at Ludwig Maximilians Universität, where he served the last 40 years of his 50-year career as a professor at 4 universities. Richard's research focused on protists (the relationship between the nucleus and the plasm = "Kern-Plasma-Relation"), as well as on developmental physiological studies on sea urchins and frogs. He also wrote a leading Zoology textbook. Oscar Hertwig was a leader in the field of comparative and causal animal-developmental history. He also wrote a leading textbook. By studying sea urchins he proved that fertilization occurs due to the fusion of a sperm and egg cell. He recognized the role of the cell nucleus during inheritance and chromosome reduction during meiosis: in 1876, he published his findings that fertilization includes the penetration of a spermatozoon into an egg cell. Oscar Hertwig experiments with frog eggs revealed the 'long axis rule', or Hertwig rule. According to this rule cell divides along its long axis (1884). While Oscar was well interested in developmental biology, he was opposed to chance as assumed in Charles Darwin´s theory. His most important theoretical book was: "Das Werden der Organismen, eine Widerlegung der Darwinschen Zufallslehre" (Jena, 1916) (translation: "The Origin of Organisms – a Refutation of Darwin's Theory of Chance"). Hertwig was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1903. Oscar Hertwig is known as Oscar Hedwig in the book "Who discovered what when" by David Ellyard. A history of the discovery of fertilization for mammals including scientists like Hertwig and other workers is given by the book "The Mammalian Egg" by Austin.

He is the author of a book detailing a comprehensive political history of the Weimar Republic, among others. During the Historikerstreit, Winkler was a leading critic of Ernst Nolte. In an essay first published in the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper on 14 November 1986, Winkler wrote of Nolte’s essay "The Past That Will Not Pass" that: “Those who read the Frankfurter Allgemeine all the way through to the culture section were able to read something under the title “The Past That Will Not Pass” that no German historian to date had noticed: that Auschwitz was only a copy of a Russian original-the Stalinist Gulag Archipelago. For fear of the Bolsheviks’ Asiatic will to annihilate, Hitler himself committed an “Asiatic deed”. Was the annihilation of the Jews a kind of putative self-defence? Nolte’s speculation amounts to that.” Writing of Nolte’s claim that Weizmann’s letter was a “Jewish declaration of war”, Winkler stated that “No German historian has ever accorded Hitler such a sympathetic treatment”.

Singh initially served in the Indian Army, reaching the rank of Major. He later volunteered to join R&AW. According to reports, he attracted attention from counter-intelligence officials when he was found photocopying documents not related to his work. After coming under suspicion, he was placed under surveillance and his phone conversations were tapped, but in May 2004, he disappeared. He is suspected of having escaped to the U.S. via Nepal. In Mission R&AW, a book written by a former R&AW officer, it is claimed that Singh flew to America from Kathmandu along with his wife on May 7, 2004 using a fake identity in the name of Mr and Mrs Rajpal Prasad Sharma. The R&AW unit at Kathmandu did nothing despite clear intelligence on Singh’s escape plans. It is also claimed that R&AW even managed to get copies of their visas and embarkation cards. These documents reveal that the CIA on April 7, 2004, issued US passport number 017384251 to Singh. His wife Parminder Kaur was also given a US passport on the same day in the name of Deepa Kumar Sharma. Both boarded Austrian Air flight number 5032 on May 7, 2004, from Kathmandu. Singh was assisted by CIA operative David M Vacala. In 2007, in an affidavit submitted to the court, R&AW deposed that Singh has been traced to New Jersey. It is believed that, meanwhile, Singh has filed for asylum in US, in the name of Surenderjeet Singh, which was rejected by the trial court but remanded back for reconsideration by the court of appeals. There has been no official proof however that Surenderjeet Singh is an alias of Rabinder Singh. Escape to nowhere, a fictional account of a defector and his pursuers, closely resembling that of Rabinder Singh's escape, was published in 2012 by Amar Bhushan one of the counter intelligence officers tasked with tracking Singh.

Opala (born August 4, 1950) is an American historian noted for establishing the "Gullah Connection," the historical links between the indigenous people of the West African nation of Sierra Leone	Joseph A. Opala (born August 4, 1950) is an American historian noted for establishing the "Gullah Connection," the historical links between the indigenous people of the West African nation of Sierra Leone and the Gullah people of the Low Country region of South Carolina and Georgia in the United States. Opala's historical research began with a study of Bunce Island, the British slave castle in Sierra Leone that was a departure point for many African slaves shipped to South Carolina and Georgia in the mid- and late 18th century Middle Passage. He was the first scholar to recognize that Bunce Island has greater importance for the Gullah than any other West African slave castle. He ranks it as "the most important historic site in Africa for the United States." Opala has traveled between Sierra Leone and the South Carolina and Georgia Low Country for 25 years, producing documentary films, museum exhibits, and popular publications on this historical connection. He is best known for a series of "Gullah Homecomings" in which Gullah people traveled to Sierra Leone to explore their historical and family ties to that country. He has drawn on his original research to establish these connections, and the work of earlier scholars, especially Lorenzo Dow Turner, an African-American linguist who in the 1930s and 1940s traced many elements of Gullah speech to West African languages. Opala's research and public history events generated a national dialog in Sierra Leone on the subject of family lost in the Atlantic slave trade. These discussions have continued for almost three decades. The Sierra Leone media first coined the phrase, "Gullah Connection," for the family ties which Opala has brought to light. He helped generate a similar dialog in the South Carolina and Georgia Low Country, where he has given public lectures and interviews to the local media, and organized workshops for teachers and cultural activists for many years. His work has helped Gullahs recognize their links to African traditions. Opala’s efforts to bring Sierra Leoneans and Gullahs together through an exploration of their common history have been recognized in both countries. In 2012, Sierra Leone’s President Ernest Bai Koroma awarded Opala the Order of the Rokel, that country’s version of the British knighthood, and Sierra Leone citizenship the following year. Opala is now a duel citizen of the U.S. and Sierra Leone. Penn Center, the oldest Gullah community organization in the United States, in 2013 inducted Opala into its prestigious "1862 Circle” for his work in cultural preservation.

He was Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Red Cross from February 2005 to July 2015. Born in Sydney, Tickner was educated at the University of Sydney. Prior to entering parliament, he worked as a university lecturer at the NSW Institute of Technology from 1974 to 1979, then as principal solicitor for the NSW Aboriginal Legal Service from 1979 to 1984. Tickner was one of the early and influential members of Friends of the Earth Australia in Sydney in 1975, being the lease owner of a three-storey terrace on Crown St, Surry Hills which became the FoE Sydney bookshop and office. He was convenor of the FoE urban campaign which opposed the Sydney City Council's inappropriate high rise development. From 1977 to 1984 he was elected as a Labor Councillor on the Sydney City Council, He also served as Deputy Mayor and a brief time as Acting Lord Mayor (in 1983). After failing to gain victory as ALP candidate for the 1981 Wentworth by-election (which was won by the Liberals' candidate Peter Coleman, former Leader of the NSW Opposition), Tickner was successful in entering the federal parliament at the 1984 Hughes by-election. Bob Hawke appointed Tickner, in 1990, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs; and he retained this post throughout Paul Keating's government. Tickner's tenure in office was marred by the Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy. Partly due to this affair, and partly due to the increasing unpopularity of the Keating administration as a whole, Tickner was resoundingly defeated in the 1996 election by Liberal challenger Danna Vale, suffering an 11-point swing against him. He was one of three ministers in the Keating government to lose his seat. He is the former chief executive of the Australian Red Cross, having served in that role from 2005 to 2015. He has been married and divorced twice. His first wife Christine later married his friend Tom Uren.

Safinaz became Queen of Egypt and changed her name to Farida when she married King Farouk I on 20 February 1938. Farouk conferred upon Zulficar the nobiliary title of Pasha on 25 August 1937, six months before the wedding ceremony. Upon his daughter's marriage, Zulficar received from the Royal Chamberlain an envelope containing a cheque for 10,000,000 Egyptian piastres (US$257,000), half of the royal dowry. Zulficar was appointed the first Egyptian ambassador to Iran on 13 March 1939. His appointment came after diplomatic relations between the two countries were upgraded to ambassadorial level. He was initially sent to Iran to prepare for the arrival of King Farouk's sister Princess Fawzia, who married Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the then crown prince (later shah) of Iran on 16 March 1939. Following the outbreak of World War II, Zulficar secretly communicated with representatives of the Axis powers in Tehran. King Farouk and many Egyptians at the time sympathized with Nazi Germany in the hope that an Axis victory would put an end to the decades-old British occupation of Egypt. Zulficar informed the German minister plenipotentiary in Tehran of Egypt's goodwill towards Germany and of the king's respect for Adolf Hitler. The most dangerous mission of Zulficar's ambassadorship took place in 1941, when he forwarded to the Germans a letter by King Farouk containing details of the forthcoming Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. In 1942, Zulficar was replaced as Egypt's ambassador to Iran by Abdel Latif Pasha Talaat. He returned to Egypt where he was nominated as a senator in July of the same year. He was renominated as a senator in May 1946. Farouk and Farida's marriage was not successful, and the two divorced in 1948. Four years later, the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 toppled King Farouk. Following Farouk's abdication and his departure from Egypt, Zulficar granted interviews to the press in which he talked about his daughter's divorce from the ex-king. This angered Farouk, who stated that "the aged, garrulous father of my first wife [...] in his dotage is apparently now ready to gossip upon intimate family matters with any wandering reporter who cares to rap upon his front door." Farouk believed the reason Zulficar was talking publicly about the divorce was because he was "no doubt anxious to ingratiate himself with [Egypt's] dangerous new regime."

Austin was born in Orwell, Vermont, and educated at Middlebury College (class of 1889) and the University of Strasbourg (then in Germany), from which he received a Ph.D. in 1893. From 1893-1901, he taught physics as an instructor and assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, then returned to Germany for two years at the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt in Berlin where he performed research on hot gases. In 1904 Austin joined the National Bureau of Standards to study radio propagation. After the United States Navy established its Naval Radio Telegraphic Laboratory (later the Naval Research Laboratory) within the bureau, Austin served as its director from 1908–1923, and from 1923-1932 as chief of the Radio Physics Laboratory. Austin's research focused on radio propagation and static, and more specifically the influence of temperature, humidity, magnetic storms, and sunspots on long-range radio transmissions. Under his direction, the Navy conducted long-distance wireless measurements in 1909 and 1910 between the USS Birmingham and USS Salem, as they steamed to Liberia and back, and Fessenden's station at Brant Rock, Massachusetts. Austin measured received impulses from the ships on the 3,750 and 1,000 meter wavelengths to determine the relationships between radio frequency, distance, and received signal strength. These measurements led Austin and collaborator Dr. Louis Cohen to develop the empirical Austin-Cohen formula for predicting radio signal strength at long distances. Austin joined the Institute for Radio Engineers (now IEEE) in 1913, in 1914 served as its third president, and in 1927 received its Medal of Honor "for his pioneer work in the quantitative measurement and correlation of factors involved in radio wave transmission." He also served as a U.S. representative at numerous international radio conferences. Austin died on June 27, 1932, in Washington, D.C.

He has held two other business school deanships (University of Chicago Booth School of Business and University of Virginia Darden Graduate School of Business Administration) and was Senior Associate Dean at University of Michigan Ross School of Business. Snyder is a strong defender of management education, having stated that the MBA is the most successful professional degree in modern history based on its general value in developing an understanding of (i) markets and competition and (ii) organizations, networks, and leadership. He foresees a greater weight going forward on a “third competency”, i.e., the ability to navigate the complexities within and across societies. Snyder has been critical of the “students are customers” view of education, and has articulated an alternative view that sets expectations and emphasizes feedback. Snyder has had extraordinary success with various business school rankings. At Michigan, when he was Senior Associate Dean in charge of the MBA program and part of a team led by B. Joseph White, the school rose to the No. 2 spot on the BusinessWeek rankings. While at Virginia, Darden reached No. 9 in BusinessWeek. When Snyder arrived at Chicago in 2001, the school never had had a No. 1 ranking and was ranked No. 10 in BusinessWeek. In 2006, during his tenure at Chicago, the school moved to No. 1 in BusinessWeek and has continued to hold the position. Chicago also gained two No. 1 rankings in The Economist during his tenure. Snyder also is a prolific fundraiser.

Wilhelm von Biela was born in Roßla, Harz (Northern Germany). He was a descendant of a prominent Protestant noble family originally from what is now the Czech Republic, the family having been exiled to Saxony after its head, Friedrich von Biela, was executed in Prague in 1621 during the religious wars of the period. Biela was the last member of his branch of the family. After study at military college in Dresden, Biela joined the Austrian army in 1802, serving as a cadet in the Infantry Regiment 'Graf Stuart' Nr. 18. He rose to the rank of a captain of Grenadiers and participated in a number of military campaigns against Napoleon between 1805, 1809 and later on. In 1813 he was an Adjutant to General Merveldt at the Battle of Leipzig, where he was wounded. In 1815 Biela went to Prague, where he commenced study of astronomy under Marin Alois David. He later served in Italy and was appointed the commandant of the town of Rovigo. In the field of astronomy, he specialized in observing and calculating the orbits of comets. He also did some sunspot observations and published a series of articles, mostly in the Astronomische Nachrichten, on subjects such as comets, the theoretical considerations of comets "falling into the Sun", Tycho Brahe, and occultations of stars by the Moon. He also published a longer work on planetary rotation, Die zweite grosse Weltenkraft, nebst Ideen über einige Geheimnisse der physischen Astronomie, oder Andeutungen zu einer Theorie der Tangentialkraft (Prague, 1836). In its preface he stated that although the work was the fruit of many years of study, it could be read through in half an hour. Biela independently discovered two comets that others had already found (notably the Great Comet of 1823, C/1823 Y1) and made one independent discovery of his own: the periodic Biela's Comet, which subsequently split in two and disintegrated. The lunar crater Biela is named after him. Relatively little seems to be recorded of Biela's personal life: he was married to Anna (Edle von Wallenstern) and they had a daughter Emilie Freiin von Biela, born in 1820 and married in Rovigo to Moritz, Graf Forgách, another Austrian infantry officer, by whom she had two children. In the 1840s Biela retired to Venice, where he died in 1856.

He was the first Leader of the Opposition of the Madras State in 1952 in a House of 375. This was before the First States Re-organisation in 1956, which led to the creation of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. This election returned a fractured mandate, without any party gaining a simple majority. The Communist-led coalition formed the largest block and staked claim to form the government. But C. Rajagopalachari, India's first Governor General after Independence who was also from Madras, came out of retirement and convinced the then Madras Governor Sri Prakasa to invite him to form a Congress government in the state. The decision was highly criticized and was viewed as the Indian National Congress' machinations to defeat a popular government led by Communists. Rajagopalachari was not an elected member of the assembly as he had not participated in the polls.[6][7][8][9] Rajagopalachari requested Prakasa to nominate him to the assembly thereby foregoing the usual process of election by the members of the assembly. Ramamurti opposed this by way of a petition in the Madras High Court seeking to annul Rajagoplachari's nomination. Ramamurti's daughter R. Vaigai writes about this during the end of a year-long celebration of his birth centenary in 2008 in The Hindu. In 1953, at the 3rd CPI party congress, he was elected to the Central Committee and the politburo of the party. In 1964, Ramamurti and Bhupesh Gupta, another towering communist who remained in the CPI till he died, led 32 leaders out of the parent party to form the CPI(M). In 1967 he was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Madurai constituency. In 1970 he became the first general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions. On 20 September 2007 CPI(M) general secretary Prakash Karat unveiled a bronze statue of P. Ramamurti in Madurai, marking the beginning of the centenary anniversary celebrations of P. Ramamurti.

On August 11, 2006, Truchelut asked two female Muslim boarders to remove their headscarves in the public rooms of this hostel. (These were the large TV room and dining hall of the hostel.) A lawsuit was initiated by "Movement Against Racism and for Friendship Between People" (MRAP). Truchelut was sued for refusal to provide a good or a service: 1.   * due to the origin, whether belonging to it or not belonging to it, of an ethnicity or a determined nationality (on grounds that two women were wearing the veil) 2.   * due to one's belonging, or not belonging, to a determined race (on grounds that two women were wearing the veil) 3.   * due to one's belonging, or not belonging, to a determined religion (on grounds that two women were wearing the veil) Presidential candidate Philippe de Villiers offered free legal services to Fanny Truchelut. The trial began on October 2, 2007, and October 9 she was convicted, fined 5800 euros, and sentenced to four months of imprisonment. The case is on appeal. In France, the case has been treated as symbolic of the Islamization of French society, the loss of control over private property, and new threats to the rights of women. In an open letter to President Sarkozy published on website Riposte laique (far-right and islamophobic)], Truchelut focuses on the rights of women. She argues that the Islamic veil is a symbol of the oppression of women and that her own arrest is symbolic of a larger struggle in France.

Henri Petit wrote several anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic books, and worked with far-right journalist Henry Coston, creator of an "Anti-Jewish Youth" organisation. Petit presented himself as an "anti-Jew" candidate for the 1936 legislative elections, which were won by the left-wing Popular Front. Petit then broke with Coston, who accused him of having stolen him money. In 1937, Petit became the secretary general of Louis Darquier de Pellepoix's Comité antijuif de France (Anti-Jewish Committee of France). In May 1942, Darquier de Pellepoix replaced Xavier Vallat as Vichy France's Commissioner for Jewish Affairs. Petit carried on a literary correspondence with the influential novelist Louis-Ferdinand Céline. Petit's work influenced Céline, who shifted more and more to the far right during his career. In 1939, Petit traveled to Nazi Germany to work in the "World Center of Anti-Semitic Propaganda". He returned to France after the proclamation by Marshal Philippe Pétain of the Vichy regime in 1940, and became the chief editor of the collaborationist newspaper Le Pilori before being replaced. Petit worked directly with the Nazi propaganda services and was, because of that, not really appreciated in collaborationist circles. In August 1944, he left for Germany where his two sons worked as volunteers in the German Army. On 18 November 1947, during the Épuration légale ("legal purge"), Petit was condemned in absentia to 20 years of prison and to "national degradation" (dégradation nationale). For some time, he lived clandestinely in Belleville, Paris, and in Meudon. After receiving amnesty in 1959, he published an astrology magazine, before collaborating with the Fédération d'action nationale et européenne (FANE), a neo-Nazi group created in 1966 by Mark Fredriksen.

Wilhelm von Biela was born in Roßla, Harz (Northern Germany). He was a descendant of a prominent Protestant noble family originally from what is now the Czech Republic, the family having been exiled to Saxony after its head, Friedrich von Biela, was executed in Prague in 1621 during the religious wars of the period. Biela was the last member of his branch of the family. After study at military college in Dresden, Biela joined the Austrian army in 1802, serving as a cadet in the Infantry Regiment 'Graf Stuart' Nr. 18. He rose to the rank of a captain of Grenadiers and participated in a number of military campaigns against Napoleon between 1805, 1809 and later on. In 1813 he was an Adjutant to General Merveldt at the Battle of Leipzig, where he was wounded. In 1815 Biela went to Prague, where he commenced study of astronomy under Marin Alois David. He later served in Italy and was appointed the commandant of the town of Rovigo. In the field of astronomy, he specialized in observing and calculating the orbits of comets. He also did some sunspot observations and published a series of articles, mostly in the Astronomische Nachrichten, on subjects such as comets, the theoretical considerations of comets "falling into the Sun", Tycho Brahe, and occultations of stars by the Moon. He also published a longer work on planetary rotation, Die zweite grosse Weltenkraft, nebst Ideen über einige Geheimnisse der physischen Astronomie, oder Andeutungen zu einer Theorie der Tangentialkraft (Prague, 1836). In its preface he stated that although the work was the fruit of many years of study, it could be read through in half an hour. Biela independently discovered two comets that others had already found (notably the Great Comet of 1823, C/1823 Y1) and made one independent discovery of his own: the periodic Biela's Comet, which subsequently split in two and disintegrated. The lunar crater Biela is named after him. Relatively little seems to be recorded of Biela's personal life: he was married to Anna (Edle von Wallenstern) and they had a daughter Emilie Freiin von Biela, born in 1820 and married in Rovigo to Moritz, Graf Forgách, another Austrian infantry officer, by whom she had two children. In the 1840s Biela retired to Venice, where he died in 1856.

Protesters regrouped after each round of shooting. Riot police finally intervened and dispersed protesters. Over one hundred protesters were injured, some seriously.

He died in hospital three days later, the seventh death in the Bahraini uprising. Buhmaid was among a group of protesters who on 18 February marched toward the Pearl Roundabout following the funeral procession of protester Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima, who was killed four days earlier. When the protesters neared Pearl Roundabout, the army opened fire. Buhmaid collapsed to the ground, and blood poured from his head after it was hit by a bullet. The army opened fire twice more. Protesters regrouped after each round of shooting. Riot police finally intervened and dispersed protesters. Over one hundred protesters were injured, some seriously. Buhmaid was taken to Salmaniya hospital where attempts to revive him failed over the course of three days. He died on the afternoon of 21 February. Several witnesses including journalists and medics accused authorities of shooting directly at protesters, preventing some ambulances from reaching the site and firing at others. The government however, denied those statements. It stated that warning shots were fired in the air and accused protesters of faking injuries. An investigation by a government-appointed commission of inquiry blamed the army for Buhmaid's death. The incident marked the first time that the Royal Bahraini Army was used to confront civilians, and at the time was considered "the bloodiest" incident since protests erupted. Following the incident, the government offered dialogue which the opposition said they will only take part in after the withdrawal of the army. The general labor union called for a general strike. Internationally, the attack on protesters was condemned by Barack Obama and Human Rights Watch. High Representative of European Union expressed her deep concerns and called for restrain and immediate dialogue. Britain revoked over forty arms licenses to Bahrain after an earlier announcement that it would review them and German president canceled a planned visit to the country. Buhmaid is remembered by the opposition as a martyr, leader and symbol of peacefulness.

On 18 May 2011, she became the first female activist to be convicted for a role in the Bahraini uprising, and was named a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. On 27 March 2011, Mubarak was driving with her 8-year-old son and her 14- and 15-year-old nieces in the car when she was stopped near Riffa (southwest of Manama) by a police checkpoint. A police officer told her that she was "playing music calling for the overthrow of the regime", and asked her to turn down the volume. Mubarak refused, instead asking the officer for his identification. According to the police officers at the scene, Mubarak then stepped from her vehicle, grabbed the shirt of an officer, and shoved him. Mubarak, in contrast, alleges that after being insulted and cursed by security officers, a man in civilian clothing tried to force her into a car; not knowing that he was a security officer, she resisted and was struck in the head by the officer. Mubarak was then taken to a police station in Rifaa. She later stated that she was beaten by policewomen while in custody there, before being transferred to a police station in Isa Town, where she was beaten again. After authorities discovered that she had participated in the March protests at Pearl Roundabout, as well as a poem she had written about revolution and freedom for her son, she was charged with "assault on a public officer", "incitement for hatred of the regime", "participation in a rally with the intent to commit crimes", and "undermining public order" by Bahrain's National Safety Court of First Instance, a military court. On 18 May 2011, she was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Amnesty International reported that she was denied a lawyer both before and during her trial, meeting her lawyer for the first time one week after receiving her sentence. On 8 June 2011, her sentence was reduced by an appeals court to eighteen months' imprisonment. This sentence was upheld by a court of cassation on 30 January 2012. Mubarak's family expressed concern for her health, as she was receiving treatment for ovarian cysts shortly before her imprisonment. The Bahrain Centre for Human Rights described Mubarak's imprisonment as "illegal detention for merely exercising [her] rights to freedom of expression in accordance to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19", and called for her immediate release. On 30 January 2012, Amnesty International named her a prisoner of conscience, "sentenced in an unfair trial before a military court on spurious charges for standing up for her rights"; the organization also called for her release.

At a rally in al-Muqsha organized by the Bahraini opposition, she was welcomed by thousands of supporters waving national flags while revolutionary music played in the background. Mubarak reported difficulties following her release, including 800 dinars in unpaid car loans and a lawsuit from her employer for "unauthorized absence".

He was born in Chester, Indiana. King graduated from Iowa State University (B.A., 1924; M.S., 1927) and Yale University (Ph.D., 1929). He spent most of his career from 1930 onward as a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He taught at universities for short periods: (Texas, 1925-27), Arizona (1929-30), UCLA (1954-56), and in the autumn of 1965 was a visiting lecturer at the University of Moscow. In 1965, he was awarded the Penrose Medal of the Geological Society of America and the Distinguished Service Medal of the U.S. Department of Interior. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966. He was attending the International Geological Congress meeting in Prague in August, 1968, when the Soviets invaded; he was evacuated to Nuremberg. King did his early field work (1925) in the Marathon region, an area of about 1,600 square miles (4,100 km2) in the trans-Pecos part of Texas, where varied rocks and structures that were formed during the Paleozoic have been stripped of the cover of younger strata that conceal them elsewhere in this part of the Southwest. His first field work in the Marathon region was on Permian marine strata that form a sequence about 7,000 feet (2,100 m) thick on the northern side of the Glass Mountains. Instead of an orderly sequence, the strata of the Glass Mountains were a disorderly array of discontinuous bodies of carbonate rocks, shale, and sandstone. An opportunity to clarify the Permian stratigraphy of western Texas came later (1934), when King began work in the southern Guadalupe Mountains about 150 miles (240 km) northwest of the Glass Mountains. During King's field work there, he gave much attention to the Capitan Limestone, which stands in lofty white cliffs at the summit of the mountains. In 1940-44, the wartime search for strategic minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey afforded King an opportunity to investigate the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia and Tennessee where he unraveled and interpreted the massive folds and low-angle thrusts of that region. As he did these earlier investigations, he was aware of their broader significance and developed regional syntheses that resulted in his publications Evolution of North America (1959), the Tectonic Map of the United States (1944; 2nd ed. 1962; National Atlas version 1989), and the compilation of the Tectonic Map of North America (1969). In 1974, he and Helen Beikman produced the Geologic Map of the United States. King and Beikman's work lives on into the digital age. Their map was re-released, complete with ArcInfo coverages, as U.S. Geological Survey Digital Data Series DDS-11, Release 2 ( ). This map was combined by José F. Vigil, Richard J. Pike, and David G. Howell in 2000, with the digital shaded-relief image created by Thelin and Pike in 1991, to create A Tapestry of Time and Terrain (  and ).

He also got the group title of the university league as a captain of the Nihon University boxing club. He experienced 38 matches during his amateur career; winning 28 (15 by knockout) and losing 10. After that as the professional, Mihara fought 25 times between 1978 and 1985; winning 24 (15 by knockout) and losing 1. He won his first title in his fifth contest as a professional, beating Jae-Keum Lim for the OPBF title, a belt that he defended six times until he returned it. In June 1981, he won via a fifth round knockout, in the undercard of Ayub Kalule vs. Sugar Ray Leonard, at the Reliant Astrodome, Houston. Since Leonard vacated the title after this, Mihara fought against Rocky Fratto for the vacant WBA world junior middleweight title in Rochester, New York on November 7, 1981. Mihara knocked him down by his right cross in the fourth round, and won the title via a majority decision. He lost his title after suffering a knockout during his first defence, against Davey Moore at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium on February 2, 1982. His lumbago became chronic from these days. Following this loss, Mihara won the Japanese junior middleweight title and defended it six times until June 1984, then returned it. He fought for a final time in March 1985, beating Tricky Kawaguchi by a unanimous decision.

He was born in Sosnowiec. While in school he constructed two simple biplane gliders in 1912 and 1913 in Milanówek. The first one crashed during pilotless tests, while the second one was used for short flights by Babiński and his friends (including later aircraft designer Władysław Zalewski). There is no information available on his service during World War I, but he probably received a pilot's training and served in the air force of one of occupants of Poland. In November 1918, as Poland regained its independence, Babiński took part in disarmament of German soldiers. He then joined the Polish Air Force with a rank of Flying 2nd Lieutenant (podporucznik pilot). He served in the 1st Scout Escadre (1 Eskadra Wywiadowcza) during the Polish-Soviet war, as a pilot of Bristol F.2 Fighter. Before and during the Battle of Warsaw he flew sorties strafing Soviet cavalry, particularly on 14 August 1920 near Pułtusk. After the war, Babiński remained in service, in air units in Lwów, Bydgoszcz, Dęblin and Warsaw, and was promoted to a rank of Flying Captain. He participated in the first Polish air contest - the 1st Polish Circuit of 1922, taking third place. As a member of Warsaw Aero Club of the Polish Aero Club, he was especially active in developing Polish touring aviation. He was the first to fly amateur ultra-light aircraft D-1 Cykacz (1925) and WZ-XI Kogutek (1927, of Zalewski's design). In 1928 he undertook the first touring raid over Poland on the Kogutek, 600 km-long. Flying the Kogutek, he took part in the 2nd Polish Light Aircraft Contest in 1928 (taking 9th place) and in the 3rd Contest in 1930, from which he withdrew. After 1929, he bought a JD-2 (SP-ACA), with which he undertook many touring flights. Assessing the possibilities for light aviation, he landed with this aircraft in at least 225 places in Poland (according to other information, 330). In 1936, he bought a RWD-7 aircraft, and then a RWD-16. Until 1937, Zbigniew Babiński landed in about 400 casual places in Poland.

He attended high school at the Liceu Nacional de Faro which he completed in 1969. Afterwards João Martins moved to Lisbon where he was graduate student of Civil Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) until 1976. He was a research assistant and assistant instructor at IST until 1981. Subsequently, he entered the graduate school in the College of Engineering, Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics of The University of Texas at Austin, USA. There he obtained a MSc in 1983 with a thesis titled A Numerical Analysis of a Class of Problems in Elastodynamics with Friction Effects and a PhD in 1986 with a thesis titled Dynamic Frictional Contact Problems Involving Metallic Bodies, both supervised by Prof. John Tinsley Oden. He returned to Portugal in 1986 and became assistant professor at IST. In 1989 he became associate professor and in 1996 he earned the academic degree of “agregado” from Universidade Técnica de Lisboa. Later, in 2005, he became full professor in the Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture of IST. His areas of research include contact solid mechanics, nonlinear dynamics and instability phenomena, mathematical methods and numerical techniques for the solution of solid mechanics problems, nonlinear constitutive laws in solid mechanics and biomechanics. His PhD thesis was on models and computational methods for the study of dynamic behaviour of metallic bodies subjected to dry frictional contacts. It contains (i) a detailed study of phenomenological interface constitutive laws (ii) a constitutive interface law incorporating the normal deformability of the interface and the Coulomb friction law, (iii) formulations of the dynamic and steady sliding contact problems together with proofs on existence and uniqueness of solutions, (iv) numerical techniques and algorithms for the study of the dynamic and steady sliding problems, (v) numerical finite element results and parametric studies on the stability of steady sliding and on friction induced oscillations. Prof. João Martins was member of the general assembly of IUTAM and served as Vice-President of the Portuguese Association for Theoretical, Applied and Computational Mechanics (APMTAC) in 2006 and 2007. He also served as president of the ICIST research institute in 2003, 2004, 2007 and 2008. João Martins died unexpectedly in his home in Lisbon on 5 August 2008. His colleagues and former PhD students remember his ability in explaining ideas with simple models in a sharp and lucid manner. In 2008 the Instituto Superior Técnico created the Professor João Arménio Correia Martins Award to recognize undergraduate students with a solid background in the fields of structural mechanics and computational mechanics. In 2009 the Associação Portuguesa de Mecânica Teórica, Aplicada e Computacional created the Young Researcher Award Professor João Martins.

Nr.; Russian: Алексе́й Ноур, Aleksey Nour; 1877–1940) was a Bessarabian-born Romanian journalist, activist and essayist, known for his advocacy of Romanian-Bessarabian union and his critique of the Russian Empire, but also for controversial political dealings. Oscillating between socialism and Russian nationalism, he was noted as founder of Viața Basarabiei gazette. Eventually affiliated with Romania's left-wing form of cultural nationalism, or Poporanism, Nour was a long-term correspondent of the Poporanist review Viața Românească. Publicizing his conflict with the Russian authorities, he settled in the Kingdom of Romania, where he openly rallied with the Viața Românească group. During World War I, Nour agitated against any military alliance between Romania and Russia. He stood out among Germanophiles and local supporters of the Central Powers, agitating in favor of a military offensive into Bessarabia, and demanding the annexation of Transnistria. This combative stance was later overshadowed by revelations that Nour was spying for Russia's intelligence service, the Okhrana. Still active as an independent socialist in Greater Romania, Alexis Nour won additional fame as an advocate of human rights, land reform, women's suffrage and Jewish emancipation. During the final decade of his life, Nour also debuted as a novelist, but did not register significant success.

In 2015, the Anders Kompass scandal broke at the UN. An internal UN report, entitled 'Sexual Abuse of Children by International Armed Forces', detailed allegations of sexual abuse by French soldiers serving with the peacekeeping operation Sangaris. Senior UN aid worker Anders Kompass, who knew the UN would not act on the report, leaked the internal report to French authorities, who reportedly thanked him. Kompass, however, suffered retaliation for this action, led mainly by the head of the Office of Internal Oversight Carman Lapointe and the head of the U.N.’s Ethics Office, Joan Dubinsky. 'A couple of weeks after Kompass was put on administrative leave on April 27, a U.N. administrative tribunal reversed the decision to place Kompass on leave.'(...) 'In one email, Lapointe bypassed the standard procedure of convening a panel of experts to determine whether an investigation has merit. Instead, she told her chief investigator that the case was too politically sensitive to convene a panel of investigators to consider its merits. In another email, she expressed a certain confidence that Kompass had been in fault.' (...) 'The decision to bypass her own office procedures prompted her chief investigator, Michael Stefanovic, to recuse himself from the probe, which he said had violated U.N. due process procedures. In a dramatic closed-door May 13 briefing before the U.N. General Assembly’s key budget committee, Stefanovic accused his boss of committing an “abuse of authority” and said that he had filed a formal complaint before the United Nations. He also took aim Lapointe and Dubinsky, saying the allegedly “independent bodies” were acting as “accomplices” with the U.N. secretary-general and [Ban Ki-Moon's chief of staff Susan] Malcorra. ' After enormous outcry in the press, and concern by member states (like France and Sweden), an independent panel was set up by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, into the French UN peacekeepers child sex scandal in the Central African Republic.

Nr.; Russian: Алексе́й Ноур, Aleksey Nour; 1877–1940) was a Bessarabian-born Romanian journalist, activist and essayist, known for his advocacy of Romanian-Bessarabian union and his critique of the Russian Empire, but also for controversial political dealings. Oscillating between socialism and Russian nationalism, he was noted as founder of Viața Basarabiei gazette. Eventually affiliated with Romania's left-wing form of cultural nationalism, or Poporanism, Nour was a long-term correspondent of the Poporanist review Viața Românească. Publicizing his conflict with the Russian authorities, he settled in the Kingdom of Romania, where he openly rallied with the Viața Românească group. During World War I, Nour agitated against any military alliance between Romania and Russia. He stood out among Germanophiles and local supporters of the Central Powers, agitating in favor of a military offensive into Bessarabia, and demanding the annexation of Transnistria. This combative stance was later overshadowed by revelations that Nour was spying for Russia's intelligence service, the Okhrana. Still active as an independent socialist in Greater Romania, Alexis Nour won additional fame as an advocate of human rights, land reform, women's suffrage and Jewish emancipation. During the final decade of his life, Nour also debuted as a novelist, but did not register significant success. His late contributions as a Thracologist were received with skepticism by the academic community.

A harsh critic of the Emperor system and the Meiji Constitution, he asserted that the Japanese were not the emperor's people, rather the Emperor was the "people's emperor". He advocated a complete reconstruction of Japan through a form of statist, right-wing socialism. Kita was in contact with many people on the extreme right of Japanese politics, and wrote pamphlets and books expounding his ideas. The government saw Kita's ideas as disruptive and dangerous; in 1937 he was implicated, although not directly involved, in a failed coup attempt and executed. He is still widely read in academic circles in Japan.

De Leeuw gained national fame in the late eighties and early nineties with television shows for broadcasting company VARA. Though satire was only a part of these shows and much of its humour was essentially harmless, he came into publicity with satire about Dutch show business personalities who were often ridiculed. Besides, many obscure musical acts were featured in his shows, many of which managed to gain national fame after they had been in De Leeuw's show (e.g. Twarres and René Klijn, a former boyband member who contracted AIDS). VARA has since continued his shows apart from a few interruptions, often with considerable success. In the early nineties, Paul de Leeuw also had some shows celebrating the new year. In the 1993-1994 show he satirized the new commercial television station RTL 5 by announcing another new station, "RTL 6" (RTL six, beter dan niks [lit. RTL six, better than nothing]). This led to a lawsuit by the RTL company, who demanded that De Leeuw withdraw his joke. He and his husband, Stephan Nugter, have adopted two children: son Kas (adopted in October 2001) and son Tobey (adopted in December 2002). Paul de Leeuw has had many hit singles in the Netherlands. He is most famous for: Vlieg met me mee (#2), Ik wil niet dat je liegt / Waarheen, waarvoor (#1), and  'k Heb je lief (#3). Since the beginning of his television and singing career he released albums and singles, always becoming a big success. On Koninginnedag 2007 he was made a Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion.

He began racing internationally in 2000 after a handful of wildcard rides, but after several years of middling results he became Aprilia's test and reserve rider in 2006. He was promoted to a regular race ride for 2008, after some strong wildcard showings including Catalunya in 2006 and Brno in 2007. Debón opened the season with a pole position in Qatar, leading on the final lap before dropping to fourth. He took his first GP win on 18 May 2008 at Le Mans in the French Grand Prix. Having qualified on pole, he correctly chose dry tyres in changeable conditions, and pulled away to a huge lead - resulting in speculation that his bike may contain traction control, in preparation for Aprilia's planned MotoGP class bike. It was the 112th GP start of his career. For 2010 he raced for Ajo Motorsport in Moto2, with a chassis by FTR Moto. He finished second in the first race in Qatar. At Assen, he crashed heavily in qualifying, breaking his collarbone having set the third-quickest time in the session. During the season, Debón announced his intention to retire at the end of the season, and will be replaced by Kevin Coghlan for the 2011 season.

He was subsequently lured to Italy by a Mossad agent, where he was drugged and abducted by Israeli intelligence agents. He was transported to Israel and ultimately convicted in a trial that was held behind closed doors. Vanunu spent 18 years in prison, including more than 11 in solitary confinement. Released from prison in 2004, he became subject to a broad array of restrictions on his speech and movement. Since then he has been arrested several times for violations of those restrictions, including giving various interviews to foreign journalists and attempting to leave Israel. He says he suffered "cruel and barbaric treatment" at the hands of Israeli authorities while imprisoned, and suggests that his treatment would have been different if he had not converted to Christianity from Judaism. In 2007, Vanunu was sentenced to six months in prison for violating terms of his parole. The sentence was considered unusual even by the prosecution who expected a suspended sentence. In response, Amnesty International issued a press release on 2 July 2007, stating that "The organisation considers Mordechai Vanunu to be a prisoner of conscience and calls for his immediate and unconditional release." In May 2010, Vanunu was arrested and sentenced to three months in jail on a charge that he met foreigners in violation of conditions of his 2004 release from jail. Vanunu has been characterized internationally as a whistleblower and by Israel as a traitor. Daniel Ellsberg has referred to him as "the preeminent hero of the nuclear era".

His works span the colonial period, Indonesia's struggle for independence, its occupation by Japan during the Second World War, as well as the post-colonial authoritarian regimes of Sukarno and Suharto, and are infused with personal and national history. The Dutch Government imprisoned him from 1947 to 1949, the Suharto regime from 1965 to 1979. Pramoedya's writings sometimes fell out of favor with the colonial and later the authoritarian native governments in power. Pramoedya faced censorship in Indonesia during the pre-reformation era despite the fact that he was well known outside Indonesia. The Dutch imprisoned him from 1947 to 1949 during the War of Independence (1945-1949). During the changeover (coup) to the Suharto regime Pramoedya was caught up in the shifting tides of political change and power struggles in Indonesia. Suharto had him imprisoned from 1969 to 1979 on the Maluku island of Buru and branded him a Communist. He was seen as a holdover from the previous regime (even though he had struggled with the former regime (Sukarno's)). It was on the Island of Buru that he composed his most famous work, the Buru Quartet. Not permitted access to writing materials, he recited the story orally to other prisoners before it was written down and smuggled out. Pramoedya opposed some policies of founding President Sukarno as well as the New Order regime of Suharto, Sukarno's successor. Political criticisms were often subtle in his writing, although he was outspoken against colonialism, racism and corruption of the Indonesian new Government. During the many years in which he suffered imprisonment and house arrest (in Jakarta after his imprisonment on Buru), he became a cause célèbre for advocates of human rights and freedom of expression.

A war correspondent during WWII, Cave afterwards settled in Jamaica where he owned and managed a coffee plantation and continued his writing career, now specializing in novels as well as fiction and non-fiction sales to mainstream magazines. Starting in the 1970s Cave enjoyed a resurgence in popularity when Karl Edward Wagner's Carcosa Press published Murgunstrumm and Others, the first hardcover collection of Cave's pulp stories. Cave relocated to Florida and regularly published original material until about the year 2000, and won a World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement in 1999.

He served as the first president of the Maldives and as the head of government between January 1, 1953 and August 21, 1953. Ameen Didi was also the principal of Majeediyya School from 1946 to 1953. Amin Didi had one daughter, Ameena Ameen. His grandson Ameen Faisal was the former Minister of Defence and National Security of Maldives. His other grandchildren are Ibrahim Faisal, Farahanaz Faisal and Aishath Shuweykar. Mohamed Amin Didi was the leader of the first political party in the Maldives, Rayyithunge Muthagaddim Party. He was well known for his efforts to modernize the country, which included the advancement of women, education in Maldives, nationalising the fish export industry and an unpopular ban on tobacco smoking. President Ameen was the son of Athireegey Ahmed Dhoshimeynaa kilegefaan and Roanugey Aishath Didi. He was a descendant of the famous dynasty of Huraa, from his father's side. In 1920, he went abroad to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and studied in St. Josephs College. In 1928, he went to India for further studies and returned to Maldives one year later. After returning to Maldives, he held many posts in the government such as the chief officer of Customs, head of the Maldivian Post Office, Minister of Trade and was also a member of the First Maldivian Parliament. With the support of the people, he abolished the 812-year-old sultanate and became the first President of the Maldives on 1 January 1953, although he had always supported a constitutional monarchy. After the death of Sultan Majeed Didi and his son Prince Hassan Fareed Didi, the members of the parliament elected Amin Didi as the next person in line to succeed the sultan. But Didi is known to have said: "for the sake of the people of Maldives I will not accept the crown and the throne". So, a referendum was held and Maldives became a republic. But the republic was short lived and a revolution was brought by the people of Male, while the President was in Ceylon for medical treatment. A period followed in which parts of the south broke and formed the short-lived United Suvadive Republic.The people of Male' appointed Velaanaagey Ibraahim Didi, the vice president of Amin as the head of the government. Amin Didi was not aware of these events which had taken place in his absence and he returned to the country ignorant of what had happened. As soon as Amin Didi returned, for his own safety he was taken to Dhoonidhoo island and was kept there under the government's supervision but was treated in the same manner as a head of state in the Maldives. Four months after being taken to Dhoonidhoo, secret letters were exchanged between him and Ibrahim Hilmy Didi, to bring an end to this revolutionary government and to restore the monarchy, with Ibrahim Hilmy as the king and Amin Didi as the prime minister. One night Amin Didi arrived in Male and tried to take control of Bandeyrige enraging the people of male' so much that he was nearly beaten to death. After that, he was thrown into a small boat (bohkuraa) near Male'. Later, the leaders of this small rebel group who wanted Mohanmed Amin as their leader were brought to court including Mohamed Amin Didi, Ibrahim Hilmy Didi and Shamsuddin Hilmy . These people were sentenced to exile. Mohamed Amin was banished to Kaafu Atoll, Gaafaru, Ibraahim Hilmy was banished to K. Gulhi and Shamsuddin Hilmy was banished to K. Himmafushi. As the former president's health deteriorated, he was brought to Vihamanafushi Island (now Kurumbaa village), where he died on 19 January 1954. A small funeral was held at Vihamanaa Fushi. He is still honoured by the citizens of his country even today for being the first president of Maldives and for introducing democracy. He is also admired by a lot of citizens in Maldives along with his large family.

He served as a Member of the House of Representatives from 3 June 1986 until 22 August 1994 when he became Minister of Social Affairs and Employment in the Cabinet Kok I following the Dutch general election of 1994. At the end of the parliamentary period, he was not included in the Cabinet Kok II after the Dutch general election of 1998 by his own request, as he wanted to focus his energies on his candidacy to succeed Wim Kok as the next Party leader of the Labour Party. Melkert returned to the Member of the House of Representatives on 13 July 1998 and became the Parliamentary leader of the Labour Party in the House of Representatives on 13 July 1998 and became the presumed de facto next Party leader of the Labour Party in all but name. He was elected the official Party leader of the Labour Party on 15 December 2001 and became the lijsttrekker (top candidate) for the Dutch general election of 2002. Melkert and Hans Dijkstal were the front runners to become the next Prime Minister in the early stages of the campaign, but the unexpected arrival of Pim Fortuyn of Livable Netherlands (LN) and later the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF), turned the polls. Fortuyn blamed the problems in the country on the Purple cabinets (in which both Melkert and Dijkstal served as ministers) and depicted Melkert and Dijkstal as two bureaucrats who were out of touch with the voter's concerns. During the election Fortuyn accused Melkert of the demonization of his character and personal integrity. After a heated campaign Fortuyn was assassinated in Hilversum a mere nine days before polling day. The Labour Party suffered a landslide defeat in the election, losing 23 seats, Melkert was blamed for the defeat primary because of his technocratic leadership in contrast to the more charismatic Fortuyn. After Fortuyn's assassination Melkert received death threats and sequentially left national politics. He resigned as Party leader of the Labour Party and Parliamentary leader of the Labour Party in the House of Representatives on 16 May 2002 and gave up his seat in the House of Representatives on 17 October 2002. Following his career in Dutch politics, he worked at the World Bank and the United Nations.

His mother was an Arab woman named Rabia Bala Hatun. It is not certain whether Alaeddin or Orhan was the elder son. Some historians claim that Alaeddin was Osman's second son, but others argue that there is a good chance that he was the oldest. Nevertheless, Orhan ruled the country and became the first Ottoman ruler to take the title of Sultan. According to tradition and Ottoman historiography as presented by historian Idris Bitlisi, Alaeddin was more passive than his energetic, warrior brother, and thus stayed at home instead of fighting to expand the newly forming Ottoman Empire. He received training in the management of state affairs. There is a good chance that Orhan was selected to inherit leadership of the Empire because of his skills as a warrior. In contrast to later Ottoman history, when succession became an issue that could lead to violent civil war, Alaeddin accepted his position graciously and there was no feud between the brothers. Alaeddin quickly submitted to his brother's rule, offering his allegiance and thus gaining the respect of the government and of the people. In fact, it seems that Alaeddin enjoyed a relaxed lifestyle and was more concerned with the fact that their father left Orhan and him no fortune along with the Empire than the issue of succession. Ties between these two brothers, unlike so many other Ottoman princes, remained amiable for the remainder of their lives. Because of his training in affairs of the state, Orhan sought Alaeddin's advice, which he received willingly. In return, Alaeddin requested the village of Fodrā and his request was granted. In 1328 or 1329, Alaeddin met with Orhan in order to congratulate him on his recent acquisition of Izmit. During this visit, Alaeddin made his most important contribution to the Ottoman Empire. He made three suggestions to Orhan in order to improve the efficiency and legitimacy of the early Ottoman Empire. These three suggestions include the introduction of a monetary system, the selection of an official Ottoman costume, and a complete reorganization of the army. During the years 1328 and 1329 silver coins were indeed stamped in Orhan Ghazi's name. On the front, they showed the Islamic article of faith. On the other side, it said (in Arabic) "May God make his reign eternal". In the same tradition as the Byzantines who had headdresses and costumes of richly embroidered material, an official, but more modest, costume was chosen for government and military workers. While the general public was allowed to wear whatever they wanted, a "coniform cap of white felt was prescribed on the grounds of the highly esteemed Arabic maxim, 'the best garment is a white one'". This way, military and government officials were able to assert their legitimacy in leadership. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the organization of the military received a complete overhaul. Alaeddin proposed that the military be divided into subsets, and an officer be placed in control of each section. This organization seems extremely simple, which leads to the conclusion that before this, there was no control over the army. Also, Alaeddin proposed that a contingent of foot soldiers be instituted that could be summoned in war time to fight. These soldiers, when instituted, had no training and the idea failed. Later on, this failed idea was replaced by the Janissary Corps, but there is no evidence that Alaeddin had anything to do with the development of the janissaries. In addition to his participation in Ottoman Empire state affairs, Alaeddin seems to have led a very pious, quiet life. He had several mosques built. The Alaeddin Bey Cami in Bursa, completed in 1335, is a fantastic example of the single unit mosque. It is very advanced architecture, with 8.2 square meters and a three-bay portico. The dome is supported by Turkish triangles and there is a single minaret. Accordingly, the “near perfection of the (Alaeddin Bey) Bursa Mosque lies in the simplicity of which an ideal space is expressed” (Goodwin 18). Although, now after having undergone restoration in the 19th century, the east and west windows are no longer directly across, but slightly askew. The minaret, if it is the original, is the first example of a minaret, but due to architectural weaknesses brought on by the placement of the minaret, it is very likely a later addition. Alaeddin Bey died in 1331 or 1332 and is buried in Bursa. He lies in his brother, Orhan's tomb.

A main figure in 19th century Romanian literature, he is best known for his Childhood Memories volume, his novellas and short stories, and his many anecdotes. Creangă's main contribution to fantasy and children's literature includes narratives structured around eponymous protagonists ("Harap Alb", "Ivan Turbincă", "Dănilă Prepeleac", "Stan Pățitul"), as well as fairy tales indebted to conventional forms ("The Story of the Pig", "The Goat and Her Three Kids", "The Mother with Three Daughters-in-Law", "The Old Man's Daughter and the Old Woman's Daughter"). Widely seen as masterpieces of the Romanian language and local humor, his writings occupy the middle ground between a collection of folkloric sources and an original contribution to a literary realism of rural inspiration. They are accompanied by a set of contributions to erotic literature, collectively known as his "corrosives". A defrocked Romanian Orthodox priest with an unconventional lifestyle, Creangă made an early impact as an innovative educator and textbook author, while pursuing a short career in nationalist politics with the Fracțiunea liberă și independentă group. His literary debut came late in life, closely following the start of his close friendship with Romania's national poet Mihai Eminescu and their common affiliation with the influential conservative literary society Junimea. Although viewed with reserve by many of his colleagues there, and primarily appreciated for his records of oral tradition, Creangă helped propagate the group's cultural guidelines in an accessible form. Later criticism has often described him, alongside Eminescu, Ion Luca Caragiale and Ioan Slavici, as one of the most accomplished representatives of Junimist literature. Ion Creangă was posthumously granted several honors, and is commemorated by a number of institutions in both Romania and neighboring Moldova. These include the Bojdeuca building in Iași, which, in 1918, was opened as the first memorial house in Romania. His direct descendants include Horia Creangă, one of the leading Romanian architects during the interwar period.

A main figure in 19th century Romanian literature, he is best known for his Childhood Memories volume, his novellas and short stories, and his many anecdotes. Creangă's main contribution to fantasy and children's literature includes narratives structured around eponymous protagonists ("Harap Alb", "Ivan Turbincă", "Dănilă Prepeleac", "Stan Pățitul"), as well as fairy tales indebted to conventional forms ("The Story of the Pig", "The Goat and Her Three Kids", "The Mother with Three Daughters-in-Law", "The Old Man's Daughter and the Old Woman's Daughter"). Widely seen as masterpieces of the Romanian language and local humor, his writings occupy the middle ground between a collection of folkloric sources and an original contribution to a literary realism of rural inspiration. They are accompanied by a set of contributions to erotic literature, collectively known as his "corrosives". A defrocked Romanian Orthodox priest with an unconventional lifestyle, Creangă made an early impact as an innovative educator and textbook author, while pursuing a short career in nationalist politics with the Fracțiunea liberă și independentă group. His literary debut came late in life, closely following the start of his close friendship with Romania's national poet Mihai Eminescu and their common affiliation with the influential conservative literary society Junimea. Although viewed with reserve by many of his colleagues there, and primarily appreciated for his records of oral tradition, Creangă helped propagate the group's cultural guidelines in an accessible form. Later criticism has often described him, alongside Eminescu, Ion Luca Caragiale and Ioan Slavici, as one of the most accomplished representatives of Junimist literature. Ion Creangă was posthumously granted several honors, and is commemorated by a number of institutions in both Romania and neighboring Moldova. These include the Bojdeuca building in Iași, which, in 1918, was opened as the first memorial house in Romania. His direct descendants include Horia Creangă, one of the leading Romanian architects during the interwar period.

Born in Blainville-Crevon, Seine-Maritime in the Haute-Normandie Region of France	Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti (20 October 1889 – 11 September 1963) was a French Dadaist painter. Born in Blainville-Crevon, Seine-Maritime in the Haute-Normandie Region of France, she was the fourth of six children born into the artistic family of Eugene and Lucie Duchamp. Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti was the younger sister of Jacques Villon née Gaston Duchamp, painter and printmaker, Raymond Duchamp-Villon sculptor and Marcel Duchamp painter, sculptor and author. She began her studies at the École des Beaux-Arts in her native Rouen when she was 16. Her early works reflected Impressionism and cubism. At age 21, she married a local pharmacist but quickly divorced, moving to the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris to be near her brother Marcel and to expand her artistic career. At age 22, she had her first major exhibit at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris. After the outbreak of World War I, she served as a nurse in Paris producing virtually nothing until 1916 when Jean Crotti returned to Paris, bearing news of Marcel and of the exciting art being made in New York. After the war, the first of her Dadaist works appeared. Completed in 1919, Multiplication Broken and Restored is a prime example of her Dada work. The composition contains Dadaist imagery with man-made objects such as a tower and cityscape. It is also believed that this piece comes directly from her private experience rather than being a severe critique of cultural norms. Also in 1919, she married artist Jean Crotti, whose painting she would greatly influence. As a wedding present, Marcel sent them instructions for a readymade which involved suspending a geometry textbook on the porch and letting the wind and rain gradually tear it apart. Completed in 1920, her work Ariette of Oblivion in the Thoughtless Chapel is regarded as the strongest Dadaist work that she created with seemingly nonsense inscriptions and mechanical imagery. However, much like Multiplication Broken and Restored, the inspiration for this piece emerged from the devotion she experienced in her relationship. This personal perspective runs contrary to the Dada sentiment of criticizing social conventions and undermining culture. In 1920 Suzanne showed several of her works at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris, along with Francis Picabia and Crotti. In April of 1921, she exhibited with Crotti at the Tabu exhibition (at the Galerie Montaigne in Paris); this was a few weeks before the Dada Salon at the same location. In 1967, in Rouen, France, her brother Marcel helped organize an exhibition called Les Duchamp: Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Suzanne Duchamp. Some of this family exhibition was later shown at the Musée National d'Art Moderne in Paris. She died in Neuilly-sur-Seine (Seine-Saint-Denis), France in 1963.

As a member of the French Historical School of economics, Simiand predicated a rigorous factual and statistical basis for theoretical models and policies. His contribution to French social science was recognized in 1931 when, at the age of 58, he was elected to the faculty of the Collège de France and accepted the chair in labor history. Simiand's career was unusual. Like many destined to become influential academics in France, he entered the École Normale Supérieure and graduated in philosophy at the top of his class in 1896. However, he quickly became interested in law and economics and submitted a thesis on the wages of coal miners in France (1904) to the faculty of law rather than becoming an academic. As a result, he foreclosed forever the possibility of a prominent university appointment. Thus in 1901 he became the librarian for the French Ministries of Commerce and Labor, a post he held until the outbreak of World War I. From 1910 on he also taught Economic History at the École Pratique des Hautes Etudes, an institution which did not require a doctorate from its lecturers. Toward the end of the nineteenth century Simiand joined the editorial board of the Année Sociologique. He became a central member of the group as editor of the economic sociology section and served as its expert on statistics. At the same time, as someone removed from the politics of French academics, he was at an institutional remove from Émile Durkheim's ambitions for transforming the French university. Simiand moved further into the administrative apparatus of the French state during World War I when he left his position as a librarian for work in the Ministry of Armaments where he played a prominent role in making policy. After the war, he served for a year as the Director of Labor for the province of Alsace-Lorraine. In addition, he took up a more permanent position as a teacher at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers. A student of Henri Bergson and Émile Durkheim, Simiand advanced a view of economics as a social science grounded in observable phenomena rather than convenient assumptions. This would imply a large program of historical and statistical research. Joseph Schumpeter, who denied the existence of a French or an Italian Historical School despite the historical current evident in their economics, acknowledged the significance of Simiand's contributions. In Schumpeter's view, Simiand should be considered a French Institutionalist. Simiand's views on scope and method, which appear in La Méthode positive en science économique (1911), were applied in his studies of real wages, money and long economic cycles. They were applied in criticism of the work of contemporary economists, as well.

Choy Weng Yang (simplified Chinese: 蔡荣恩; traditional Chinese: 蔡榮恩; pinyin: Cài Róng Ēn) is a Singaporean artist, curator and arts writer and a proponent of the art fraternity in post-independent Singapore. His literary contributions on post-modern arts in Singapore, had helped shaped the contemporary art scene in Singapore. Born 12 July 1930 in Singapore, Choy graduated with a National Diploma of Art UK from Hornsey College of Art in 1962 and received the Art Teachers' Certificate (UK) from the University of London Institute of Education in 1963. In his years as a student in London, he had many opportunities to study the works of great modern artists like Picasso and Mondrian, through visits to other European cities. These opportunities to travel, shaped his knowledge of art and his aesthetic development for his art in the years to come. Back in Singapore after graduating from the Institute Choy worked as assistant lecturer in the Arts & Crafts Department of the Teachers' Training College, and subsequently took office as a Curator of Art with the National Museum of Singapore in 1978. In his professional capacity he has served actively for the arts circle, receiving acclamation for his art criticisms for artists and writings about local artistic movements. Choy's passion for painting never left him despite his heavy work commitments, and actively participated in group artshows in Australia and Paris. In 1982, Choy had contributed to an article on Singapore art, and published in the very first Singapore art directory, titled "Singaporean artists". This book was officially launched at the 1982 National Day Art Exhibition, by the then Minister of State for Culture, Major Fong Sip Chee, on 16 Aug 1982. His exposures to the western art during his curatorship tenure, enabled him to develop his artistic side. In the early years he was particularly influenced by the works by Monet, for its light and colour in his paintings. Progressively he found that using light and colour alone on his canvas was not enough in his own compositions. Cézanne's use of structure in his composition, and Mondrian's strength in order, clarity and strong composition design thus became an important elements in Choy's paintings from 1985 on. It is also in the same year that Choy decided to retire from his curatorial position to devote himself as a full-time painter. In the 1990s, Choy's works are increasingly influenced by Chinese ink and wash paintings by the great Chinese masters of bygone dynasties. In the years that followed after his retirement, Choy continued to be active in the arts scene. Choy's curatorial experience continued to be sought after by many art aficionados and artists alike, and frequently pens art criticisms and introductions of artists for their exhibitions and art publications.

He is also an accomplished author under his reputed moniker Zǐ Mù (子木), and an art critic for the Singapore visual arts community. Ho was born the eldest of five children, in Hainan. When he was born, his father had left the family to come to Kuala to work as a cook for a British family. Much of his childhood years was spent with his mother, a housewife on the island, and at the outbreak of Second Sino-Japanese War Ho and his mother had escaped the invaders' capture and reunite with the elder Ho in Kuala Lumpur in 1941. He was 5 when he arrived in the city, only to find that the city had fallen to the Japanese a year later. Life was harsh, but the studious boy continued his education with the Chung Hwa Confucian Primary School (尊孔小学). In school, he learnt basic Chinese calligraphy and art lessons in class, copying drawings made by his teacher on the blackboard. In his free time, he would immerse himself at comic book stalls along Petaling Street (Chinese: 茨厂街; pinyin: cíchǎng jiē)， poring through Chinese wuxia comics (Chinese: 连环书; pinyin: liánhuán shū) and copying the comic book characters back home. He continued school at Chung Hwa Confucian High School (尊孔中学) until in 1951, when his family relocated to Singapore. He attended the Chinese High School, and developed strong interest in art under the influence of school teachers Liu Kang and Chen Wen Hsi. As he was a poor and could not afford art materials, Chen would often offer him money to buy the art materials. Ho's confidence in his art grew as he was proficient with Chinese calligraphy and often won awards in school. When he was 18 years old, his mother died of cervical cancer shortly after giving birth to his youngest sister. Without their mother, Ho had to take on the responsibility of taking care of his siblings and a 4-and-half months old infant sister, while his father was away working in a British household. As his father earned little as a cook, Ho often had to seek credit for food and provisions from shop owners. In 1962 Ho graduated from Nanyang University with a Bachelor (Arts) in Chinese Language and Literature. In 1963, Ho along with seven other artists Wee Beng Chong, Tong Siang Eng, Tay Chee Toh, Tan Yee Hong, Johnda Goh and Ng Yat Chuang frequently gathered together to discuss the development of the country’s fine art, and came to develop a singular thought that modern art for Singapore should be explored with loft and zeal. And so in October that year they founded the Modern Art Society, and launched their First Modern Art Exhibition at the National Library. In 1975, Ho was presented with an award the Malay arts group APAD (Angkatan Pelukis Aneka Daya) for his contribution in promoting art among different racial art groups in Singapore and uniting various ethnic art organisations. Ho's art evolved through his years, from Chinese calligraphy aesthetics ingrained in him when he was a schoolboy, to Western art influences by Impressionism and by mother-and-child paintings by Fauvist masters. In the 1950 - 60s, Ho found his true calling in his artistic expressions, when he laid eyes on Nature-themed semi-abstract paintings and Surrealism for the first time. He was especially enthralled by the free movements of American artists like Jackson Pollock and other artists existing at the time of his youth. This new spirited aesthetic resonated with the Taoist saying, Let thinking be like a bird in the sky - a saying that lived close to his art throughout his life. It inspired him to live freely in his canvas, escaping from the world of rigidity and systemic restrictions that humans live in. It enabled him to break boundaries in his expression on, and beyond the canvas. Together with his penchant for blue, red and black colours on his palette, his paintings show a unique artistic identity that is signature to Ho Ho Ying.

Many years later Alida van den Bos, one of the gold-winning gymnasts, told in an interview how important Kleerekoper's contribution was: "The training for the Olympics always took place at indoor gymnasiums even though the Olympics that year took place at an outdoor stadium. A few months prior to the Olympics, Kleerekoper made us only practice outdoors because he said that you never know how the weather will be the day of the Olympics and that we must be prepared for hot weather or any weather. The practice outside was very good, because we noticed that you have a lot more energy outdoors than needed."

Kristoffer served Archbishop Olav Engelbrektsson, the interregnum leader of Norway, in the last years of the Kalmar Union. Kristoffer is famous for playing a role in the last years before the Reformation in Norway, first as the head of the national fleet, defending Norway from attacking Danish ships; and also as the murderer of Vincent Lunge, a Danish nobleman sent to Bergen in 1537 to enforce the Danish annexation of Norway by the King of Denmark Christian III. This dramatic moment in Norwegian history is memorialized today in an annual "midnight opera" sponsored by the Norwegian Ministry of Culture. Titled Olav Engelbrektsson, it takes place on the premises of the castle, outside Trondheim. Kristoffer appealed for pardon from Christian III, probably for the murder but also for his piracy of the Norwegian coast under foreign flags, under which he attacked Danish ships and installations in Norway after 1536. He was granted a post under the Danish crown, which badly needed a naval leader. He served for several years as an admiral in the Danish Navy, and later in Copenhagen as a Royal Danish Consul to the King. His most famous child was Anna Throndsen, known in Norway as "the Scottish Lady" (Skottefruen). Anna is famous in modern-day Norway, for her days in the court of Mary Queen of Scots, during her marriage to James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell.

Before his death, Rosenberg recorded a video message saying if he were murdered, Álvaro Colom Caballeros, President of Guatemala, Gustavo Alejos, Sandra Torres de Colom, and Gregorio Valdés would have been directly responsible. His subsequent killing caused a national uproar. After an investigation by a United Nations commission, officials declared that Rosenberg had arranged his own death and had contacted cousins of his former wife, Francisco José Ramón Valdés Paiz and José Estuardo Valdés Paiz, to hire a hitman. Carlos Castresana, the head of the CICIG, the United Nations Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, who headed the investigation at that time, emphasized that this was a provisional hypothesis. The cousins accused were sent to jail for complicity in a hearing behind closed doors, where they remained without a trial for more than two years. Further investigation by the same commission has turned up links between the killers that shot Rosenberg and those of Marjorie and Khalil Musa. Two of the killers who took part in both killings and had originally changed their testimony to accuse the Valdés Paiz brothers have accused the Public Ministry of Guatemala and the United Nations Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala of pressuring them to accuse the Valdés Paiz brothers.

Diskin was the Chair of the Political Science Department of the Hebrew University and the Chair of the Israel Political Science Association. He also served as a visiting professor at several universities in the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan. Diskin has published over twenty books and monographs, mostly about Israeli politics. In the 1970s, Diskin analyzed the critical importance of the domination of the ‘pivotal point’ (i.e. the balance between the left wing bloc and the right wing bloc), and the significance of voters floating between two major political blocs. During the 2000s, he helped to write the Constitution proposed by the Institute for Zionist Strategies and advised the Constitution Committee of the Knesset. Diskin's research focuses on comparative politics, democracy, game theory, electoral systems and voting behavior. During the 2000s he published (often in conjunction with Moshe Koppel) two solutions to John Nash’s bargaining problem, a solution of the Voting Power measurement, a proof of the association between ‘strategic non-voting’ and ‘decisiveness’ of electoral competitions in the United States and Britain in the twentieth century, a proof of homogeneity in Swiss referenda, and a new measure of electoral malapportionment, volatility and disproportionality. Diskin often appears as a political analyst on the Israeli and international media. In the 1980s and the early 1990s, he chaired the Cadets’ Committee of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since the 1990s he has served as the statistician of the Central Committee of Elections in Israel. He is known as a political centrist and was one of the founders of the Third Way party in 1996.

Steel played on the second tier Nike Tour, now the Web.com Tour, in 1997, before moving up to the elite PGA Tour for 1998 after graduating from the Qualifying Tournament.

He returned in 2003 after a season on the Canadian Tour but continued to struggle, before trying to qualify for the European Tour at the end of 2004. He reached the final stage of qualifying school to earn a limited card for Europe's second tier Challenge Tour for 2005.

Ginsburg was born in Manhattan on April 20, 1912, and moved with his family to Huntington, West Virginia as a child. He graduated from West Virginia University in 1932 and earned his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1935. After graduating from law school, he found a position at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with the assistance of Felix Frankfurter, interrupted by a one-year-long Supreme Court clerkship with Associate Justice William O. Douglas. During World War II, Ginsburg served on the staff of the Office of Price Administration from 1941 until his resignation in 1943, where his hires included Richard Nixon, who had just graduated from the Duke University School of Law. Criticized for attempting to use influence to obtain a commission as an officer, President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to his support, writing that "when the political storms blow over..., David’s patriotic, unselfish and distinguished service to his country will be duly recognized." Ultimately, Ginsburg enlisted as a private in the United States Army, where he drove trucks for a supply unit. He later earned the rank of captain and served on the staff of General Lucius D. Clay, the Military Governor of the U.S. Occupation Zone in Germany. There he provided guidance in the rebuilding and reconstruction of the German economy and attended portions of the Nuremberg Trials and the Potsdam Conference. After completing his military service, Ginsburg returned to Washington, where he founded a law firm and became the founders of Americans for Democratic Action. As counsel to the Jewish Agency and adviser to Chaim Weizmann, he paved the way for Harry S. Truman's recognition of the state of Israel in 1948. President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Ginsburg in 1967 to serve as executive director of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, commonly known as the Kerner Commission after its chair, Governor Otto Kerner, Jr. of Illinois. In the wake of inner city riots in the late 1960s, the commission's report became a surprise best seller, warning that the unrest by African-Americans was a result of systematic white racism in which the United States was "moving toward two societies—one black, one white, separate and unequal." Ginsburg wrote that "white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto.., White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it and white society condones it." Johnson broke his relationship with Ginsburg after the release of the report, upset that his presidential efforts to defend the civil rights of all Americans were not credited in the report. Decades later, Ginsburg remained pessimistic about the future of race relations, citing the continued lag in education, housing and employment by African-Americans. He served as general counsel to the Democratic National Committee during the 1968 presidential campaign and helped craft Hubert Humphrey's campaign platform opposing the Vietnam War. As attorney for Henry Kissinger, Ginsburg successfully fought to prevent the release of transcripts of Kissinger's phone conversations with President Richard Nixon as falling outside the purview of the Freedom of Information Act. The position was supported by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 5 to 2 verdict in Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press on the basis of the fact that the discussions were not related to the executive branch of government. Ginsburg died at age 98 of congestive heart failure on May 23, 2010, in his home in Alexandria, Virginia. He was survived by his third wife, Marianne Lais Ginsburg, as well as a daughter, two sons and two grandchildren.

He later received Ph.D. (1959) and D.Sc. (1971) degrees from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. As a master's degree candidate at the University of Illinois, he organized and led (1938–1941) four multi-disciplinary biological expeditions into the mountain and desert portions of western and southwestern Mexico. These resulted in the amassing of large, scientifically valuable collections of animals and plants. During World War II, Hoogstraal was assigned to the U.S. Army 19th Medical General Laboratory, near Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea, where in 1945 he and Willard V. King engaged in a massive taxonomic study of the mosquitoes of that area. Their time for working up and publishing on their large and rich New Guinea mosquito collection was limited by the forward movement of the war and by the necessity for involvement in other projects in the war's aftermath, but they published descriptions of 36 new species of mosquitoes from their New Guinea collections in a series of 11 papers that contributed to an understanding of the rich and then largely unknown culicid fauna of the southwest Pacific. Additionally, their collections, deposited in the U.S. National Museum, have through the intervening years served as a rich resource to many other individuals involved in taxonomic research on Southwest Pacific mosquitoes. With the end of World War II, Hoogstraal did not seek an early return to the United States as did most of his Army colleagues. Instead, he took his discharge in Manila and, under the auspices of the Field Museum, organized a major biological expedition into the interior of the Philippine islands of Mindanao and Palawan (1946-1947) and spent the next two years exploring and collecting in those biologically poorly known islands. The collections resulting from his efforts were the richest ever made from those portions of the Philippines. Following his return from the Philippines in 1948, he joined, as an employee of the United States Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, the University of California African Expedition in 1948–1949. This began his lifelong sojourn in Africa. At the completion of this expedition he continued on for a while in Madagascar and then moved to Cairo, Egypt, to organize and become Head of the Department of Medical Zoology, U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3), a position which he held for the remainder of his life. At NAMRU-3 he devoted much of his time to gathering collections of scientifically valuable specimens from remote or little-studied areas of the world and contributing them freely to institutions and specialists everywhere. Eighteen-hour working days were the usual with him. This propensity enabled him to accomplish an enormous amount of work, as demonstrated by the fact that during his lifetime he authored or co-authored more than 500 publications, edited many more and directed the translation of over 1,800 scientific papers and books. He was at one time or another a member of more than 30 professional societies, served in a volunteer capacity in at least 20 professional and editorial posts, lectured on countless occasions to scientific groups, participated in the graduate training of a number of students, and built and managed for many years an outstanding Department of Medical Zoology at NAMRU-3 in Cairo.

McNeil was born in Bethel, Connecticut, on July 13, 1915, and was raised in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia.

Elixir Tylenol, a liquid medicine advertised "for little hotheads" went on sale as the first product bearing the Tylenol brand name. McNeil was named chairman of McNeil in 1956 and he remained as chairman of the company after it was purchased in 1960 by Johnson & Johnson for $30 million in stock and was operated as a subsidiary of that firm. In 2006, the Philadelphia Museum of Art exhibited 50 pieces of presidential china that McNeil donated to the museum, part of a collection of 450 pieces that ranged from the presidencies of George Washington through Ronald Reagan. The collection includes a large number of pieces of the rare Lincoln china service.

Following his marriage, Herman became known for feeding and lodging dozens of people in his home, including visiting European rabbis seeking kosher meals. He displayed a staunch commitment to mitzvah observance at a time that many abandoned their faith, and urged promising young Jewish men to pursue advanced Torah study in the great yeshivas of Europe, including his son-in-law, Rabbi Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg (1910–2012).

He was an Iowa State University Professor of Political Science with research interests in organizational theory, human resource management, and science policy. He taught at ISU for 27 years and endowed a scholarship that bears his name. His most notable works include a book entitled A Reasonable Public Servant: Constitutional Foundations of Administrative Conduct in the United States. The book details case histories of issues surrounding human resource management and the law. Lee has argued that it is incorrect to think that government should be run as a business. He says that, Unfortunately, many are led to believe this is the primary goal of public administration...the media and others have convinced the public that public administration should be able to function like business. Self-serving politicians preach this, too. They moralize that everything in government should be based on the consideration of economics and efficiency. All public administrators who enter upon public service take an ‘oath' affirming they will be faithful to the Constitution of the United States. If public administrators are to remain faithful to the Constitution then they need to defend the values, principles and ethics underpinning that document. When you get right down to it, I believe most people would agree fairness is the most important attribute for a public servant. However, the public are misguided by the market paradigm to believe efficiency and returns on investment be the guiding principles for a public servant. Lee now serves as the Director of the English Program at the Korean Development Institute's Graduate School of Public Policy and Management.

He was prominent among the reformers who campaigned against the various saloons, clubs and other "immoral establishments" of New York's underworld. His 1868 expose of John Allen caused the saloon keeper to become infamously known as "the wickedest man in New York" and forced to close his dance hall. Dyer was also one of the signatories of the Water Street Revival "street preaching" document, which supported attempts by religious leaders to convince saloon keepers and other criminal figures to abandon crime as a way of life.

He is considered one of the most influential proponents of Nonconformist Art before and after the fall of the Iron Curtain in Russia. As he grew up in the Soviet Union, Novikov experienced its cultural and political constraints. His artistic education began at the age of seven at the House of Pioneers in Leningrad, and later at the Young Art Historians Club at the Russian Museum in the same city. In 1977 he became a member of the Letopis (Chronicles) art group; and in 1982 he founded the Novye khudozhniki (New Artists) movement. During the 1980s Novikov worked at the Russian Museum and enjoyed access to its collection and archive, as well as close working relationships with its curators. This connection lasted to when he started work as an artist. In 1990 and 1991 he studied as an intern at the Institut des Arts Plastiques (Institute of Plastic Arts) in Paris, France. During the 1980s and 1990s Novikov was a regular participant in the Pop Mekhanika show of experimental composer Sergey Kuryokhin and worked on its stage design. Several pop groups from the show worked with him to explore a new visual and stage design. In 1983 Novikov founded and led an experimental rock-group Novye Kompozitory (New Composers) and invented new musical instruments for it. He was also involved in a number of film projects as an actor and artist, and made a name as an innovative film designer. In 1987 Novikov shared the Nika Award for his contribution to the popular Russian film Assa, directed by Sergei Solovyov. The New Academy of Fine Arts, founded by Novikov in 1989, soon became a well-known meeting point for the Leningrad, Russian and international art scene and a symbol for the spirit of freedom and recomposition in the new Russia. The academy and artist community, named also after its address Pushkinskaya 10, was at first self-organized by artists. It later offered ateliers as well as regular courses for students, including scholarships. The academy, with Novikov as one of its most prominent teachers, was sometimes referred to as an underground art project, but also cooperated with established art institutions, among them the Russian Museum and the Hermitage Museum. The core conception of the academy was called Neo-Academism and comprised a specific teacher-student relationship as well as a focus on the historic and aesthetic perspective of Neoclassicism. Novikov also contributed to numerous art exhibitions outside Russia. His style of painting combined a bold avant-garde attitude with refined classically based conceptions of Neo-Academism. Furthermore, he contributed to contemporary art theory, writing books such as "The New Russian Classicism" (1998), "Horizons" (2000), and "Intercontacts" (2000), published by the Russian Museum. A lengthy illness led to blindness in the later part of Novikov's career. He continued working as a lecturer at the New Academy and led assistants to work on graphic works. Novikov died of pneumonia on May 23, 2002, in St. Petersburg. Posthumous exhibitions of Novikov's works were held at the Moscow Russian Museum and in Brussels in 2002, in Denmark 2004, London 2005 and 2012, and several times in St. Petersburg. In spring 2013 the Moscow Museum of Modern Art presented a large-scale solo retrospective of Novikov's work, curated by Ekaterina Andreeva, the leading academic researcher at the State Russian Museum and author of Novikov’s biography.

Schroder was first elected to the House in 2007 by a conservative constituency in both St. Tammany and Tangipahoa parishes, but after redistricting in 2011, District 77 is now based solely in St. Tammany Parish. A graduate of East Jefferson High School in Metairie in Jefferson Parish, Schroder thereafter received a Bachelor of Science degree in criminal justice from Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond. He served as a special agent in the United States Army. Schroder is a real estate agent, homebuilder, and developer. He and his wife, the former Ellie Marie Daigle, have two children, Brittany Leigh Schroder and John M. Schroder, Jr. The Schroders are Roman Catholic. In the 2007 nonpartisan blanket primary to replace the term-limited Republican Diane Winston, Schroder led a three-candidate field with 8,534 votes (46.5 percent). He was thrust into a general election on November 17 with fellow Republican Colleen Hawley, also of Covington, who finished with 6,567 votes (41.2 percent). The remaining 2,272 votes (12.4 percent) votes went to Democrat Angelique LaCour. In the general election, with a much lower turnout than in the primary because of the lack of gubernatorial competition, Schroder defeated Hawley, 4,821 (51.2 percent) to 4,602 (48.8 percent). Schroder is a member of the House committees on (1) Civil Law and Procedure, (2) Homeland Security, (3) Education, (4) Military and Veterans Affairs, and (5) Joint Budget.Originally, Schroder was named to the Appropriations Committee, but he was removed from the panel in the spring of 2010 in a dispute with the outgoing Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives Jim Tucker of Algiers. Tucker claimed that Schroder broke his word regarding a commitment to support the Independent, subsequently Republican, Representative Joel Robideaux of Lafayette for the vacant position of Speaker pro tem. Instead, Schroder voted for the Democrat, later Republican, Noble Ellington of Winnsboro for the post, which still narrowly went to Robideaux. Schroder said that he had never agreed to support Robideaux for the position and that Tucker must have had other motivations for removing him from the Appropriations Committee, particularly since Schroder is opposed to annual automatic pay increases provided for nearly all state employees. Involved also in child protection issues, Schroder chairs the task force on Legal Representation of Children. He offered the motion in 2011 in the House Civil Law and Procedure Committee to defer a proposal by Democratic Representative Helena Moreno of New Orleans to permit adoptions by homosexual couples. Schroder has a 100 percent voting score by Louisiana Right to Life. In 2010, he received a 90 percent score from the Louisiana Family Forum and 81 percent from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. In 2009, he was ranked 75 percent by the Louisiana National Federation of Independent Business. Though a Republican, Schroder announced his support of the Democrat Walt Leger, III, of New Orleans as the Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, the choice of incoming Governor John Bel Edwards. In return for his support for Leger, who is opposed by the Republican Cameron Henry, Schroder was to have been named chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. However, lawmakers rebuked Edwards' choice and chose another Republican Speaker, Taylor Barras of New Iberia.

August 1] 1873 – September 11, 1941) was a Bulgarian socialist revolutionary, a Bolshevik politician and Soviet diplomat; he was also noted as a journalist, physician, and essayist. Rakovsky's political career took him throughout the Balkans and into France and Imperial Russia; for part of his life, he was also a Romanian citizen. A lifelong collaborator of Leon Trotsky, he was a prominent activist of the Second International, involved in politics with the Bulgarian Social Democratic Union, Romanian Social Democratic Party, and the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Rakovsky was expelled at different times from various countries as a result of his activities, and, during World War I, became a founding member of the Revolutionary Balkan Social Democratic Labor Federation while helping to organize the Zimmerwald Conference. Imprisoned by Romanian authorities, he made his way to Russia, where he joined the Bolshevik Party after the October Revolution, and, as head of the Rumcherod, unsuccessfully attempted to generate a communist revolution in the Kingdom of Romania. Subsequently, he was a founding member of the Comintern, served as head of government in the Ukrainian SSR, and took part in negotiations at the Genoa Conference. He came to oppose Joseph Stalin and rallied with the Left Opposition, being marginalized inside the government and sent as Soviet ambassador to London and Paris, where he was involved in renegotiating financial settlements. He was ultimately recalled from France in autumn 1927, after signing his name to a controversial Trotskyist platform which endorsed world revolution. Credited with having developed the Trotskyist critique of Stalinism as "bureaucratic centrism", Rakovsky was subject to internal exile. Submitting to Stalin's leadership in 1934 and being briefly reinstated, he was nonetheless implicated in the Trial of the Twenty One (part of the Moscow Trials), imprisoned, and executed by the NKVD during World War II. He was rehabilitated in 1988, during the Soviet Glasnost period.

He is best known for his novel El éxodo de Yangana (1949), which placed him among the most prominent authors of Ecuador. Rojas got into the literary world early during his student years. While doing his law degree at the University of Loja, he was editor of the University magazine. Rojas founded the Socialist Party of Loja in 1927. Another of Rojas' inclinations developed during his college years, the attraction toward socialism. Even as a student, he was an energetic and dedicated member of the Ecuadorian Socialist Party. Later on, however, he had a falling out with the party. But that parting did not deter his fascination with socialist ideology. It was this passionate support of socialism that led to his arrest and imprisonment by the Ecuadorian government in 1941. Rojas was appointed the Comptroller of the nation by the Ecuadorian President José María Velasco Ibarra during one of his five presidential terms. He was awarded Ecuador's National Prize in Literature "Premio Eugenio Espejo" in 1997. Rojas died in his sleep on July 21, 2003.

August 1] 1873 – September 11, 1941) was a Bulgarian socialist revolutionary, a Bolshevik politician and Soviet diplomat; he was also noted as a journalist, physician, and essayist. Rakovsky's political career took him throughout the Balkans and into France and Imperial Russia; for part of his life, he was also a Romanian citizen. A lifelong collaborator of Leon Trotsky, he was a prominent activist of the Second International, involved in politics with the Bulgarian Social Democratic Union, Romanian Social Democratic Party, and the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Rakovsky was expelled at different times from various countries as a result of his activities, and, during World War I, became a founding member of the Revolutionary Balkan Social Democratic Labor Federation while helping to organize the Zimmerwald Conference. Imprisoned by Romanian authorities, he made his way to Russia, where he joined the Bolshevik Party after the October Revolution, and, as head of the Rumcherod, unsuccessfully attempted to generate a communist revolution in the Kingdom of Romania. Subsequently, he was a founding member of the Comintern, served as head of government in the Ukrainian SSR, and took part in negotiations at the Genoa Conference. He came to oppose Joseph Stalin and rallied with the Left Opposition, being marginalized inside the government and sent as Soviet ambassador to London and Paris, where he was involved in renegotiating financial settlements. He was ultimately recalled from France in autumn 1927, after signing his name to a controversial Trotskyist platform which endorsed world revolution. Credited with having developed the Trotskyist critique of Stalinism as "bureaucratic centrism", Rakovsky was subject to internal exile. Submitting to Stalin's leadership in 1934 and being briefly reinstated, he was nonetheless implicated in the Trial of the Twenty One (part of the Moscow Trials), imprisoned, and executed by the NKVD during World War II. He was rehabilitated in 1988, during the Soviet Glasnost period.
