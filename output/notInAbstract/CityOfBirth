http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shoghi_Effendi	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acre,_Israel	Shoghí Effendí Rabbání (March 1, 1897 – November 4, 1957), better known as Shoghi Effendi, was the Guardian and appointed head of the Bahá'í Faith from 1921 until his death in 1957. After the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1921, the leadership of the Bahá'í community changed from that of a single individual to an administrative order with executive and legislative branches, the head of each being the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice, respectively. Shoghi Effendi was referred to as the Guardian, and had the authority to interpret the writings of the three central figures of the religion and define the sphere of legislative authority. His writings are effectively limited to commentaries on the works of the central figures, and broad directives for the future. Future hereditary Guardians were permitted in the Bahá'í scripture by appointment from one to the next with the prerequisite that appointees be male descendants of Bahá'u'lláh. At the time of Shoghi Effendi's death, all living male descendants of Bahá'u'lláh had been declared Covenant-breakers by either `Abdu'l-Bahá or Shoghi Effendi, leaving no suitable living candidates. Shoghi Effendi died without making an appointment, and the Universal House of Justice, the only institution authorized to adjudicate on situations not covered in scripture, later announced that it could not legislate to make possible the appointment of a successor to Shoghi Effendi. Shoghi was the first and last person acknowledged as Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amos_Tversky	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haifa	Amos Nathan Tversky (Hebrew: עמוס טברסקי‎‎; March 16, 1937 – June 2, 1996) was a cognitive and mathematical psychologist, a student of cognitive science, a collaborator of Daniel Kahneman, and a figure in the discovery of systematic human cognitive bias and handling of risk. Much of his early work concerned the foundations of measurement. He was co-author of a three-volume treatise, Foundations of Measurement (recently reprinted). His early work with Kahneman focused on the psychology of prediction and probability judgment; later they worked together to develop prospect theory, which aims to explain irrational human economic choices and is considered one of the seminal works of behavioral economics. Six years after Tversky's death, Kahneman received the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics for the work he did in collaboration with Amos Tversky. (The prize is not awarded posthumously.) Kahneman told The New York Times in an interview soon after receiving the honor: "I feel it is a joint prize. We were twinned for more than a decade."Tversky also collaborated with many leading researchers including Thomas Gilovich, Itamar Simonson, Paul Slovic and Richard Thaler. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Tversky as the 93rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with Edwin Boring, John Dewey, and Wilhelm Wundt.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucia,_Countess_of_Tripoli	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antioch	Lucia (died aft. 1292 or ca 1299) was the last countess of Tripoli, a Crusader state in the Levant. She was the daughter of Bohemund VI, Prince of Antioch and Sibylla of Armenia. Her brother was Bohemund VII of Tripoli. When Bohemund VII died in 1287, their mother appointed as regent Bertrand of Gibelet. He proved to be very unpopular with the commune of the city, who created their own administration. Lucia then came to Tripoli from Auxerre, where she had married ca 1275 or 1278 Narjot de Toucy, to take control of the county, although she was opposed by both the commune and the Genoese. The Genoese, led by Benedetto Zaccaria, tried to install a podestà, an official administrator from Genoa, which would have made Tripoli essentially a Genoese colony. At this the leader of the commune consented to acknowledge Lucia, but Lucia unexpectedly allied herself with the Genoese instead. The Venetians and Pisans, who also had trading links with Tripoli, were shocked at this and supposedly conspired with the Mameluk sultan Qalawun to attack the city. Lucia allied with the Mongols, who, knowing that Tripoli was too weak to defend itself even with their help, asked for support from Europe, although no aid was to be found there. Qalawun started the Siege of Tripoli for one month in 1289 and captured it on April 26. Two years later Acre, the last Crusader outpost in the Holy Land was also captured. Although he could have claimed the county through her, Lucia's husband never came to Tripoli, as he was attending to business in the Kingdom of Naples, where he died in 1292. The date of Lucia's death is unknown. Narjot and Lucia had one son, Philippe de Toucy, who inherited the lordship of Terza on Narjot's death and the claim to Antioch on Lucia's death.	
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aksel_Airo	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turku	Aksel Fredrik Airo (1898, Turku – 1985) was a Finnish lieutenant general and main strategic planner during the Winter War and the Continuation War. He was the virtual second-in-command of the Finnish army under Field Marshal C.G.E. Mannerheim. As a young man he became a supporter of Finnish independence. His father changed the original, Swedish, family name Johansson to Airo (lit. "oar"). During the Civil War in Finland (1918), Airo served in the artillery on the White side, taking part in battles near Viipuri. At the end of the war he was a lieutenant. Afterwards he was trained as an officer in Lappeenranta artillery school and was sponsored to the French military academy, École militaire in St.-Cyr in 1920. In 1921 he was accepted into École Supérieure de Guerre, the French officer training academy, from which he graduated as a captain in 1923, at the age of 27. Mannerheim invited him to join Finland's Defense Council as a secretary. Airo rose swiftly in rank, mainly because newly independent Finland needed suitable officers for the fledgling army. He had, however, some professional challenges because he was neither a Germany-trained Jaeger officer, nor one of the officers trained in the Tsar's army during Russian rule. Still, by 1930 he had become a colonel. In the beginning of the Winter War, Mannerheim appointed Airo as Quartermaster-General, and he was promoted to major general, and two years later to lieutenant general. On November 18, 1944, Marshal Mannerheim made him a Knight of the Mannerheim Cross in Order of the Cross of Liberty. Airo was in the Mikkeli headquarters during the war and rarely went to the field. He was responsible for operational planning and the presentation of operations, or, as he allegedly said, "The Marshal leads the war, but I lead the battles". They had many differences in opinion but still managed to work well together. After the Continuation War, the now Communist-dominated Valpo (the Finnish State Police) arrested him for his alleged involvement in the so-called Weapons Cache Case. He was imprisoned from 1945 to 1948 without being sentenced, until president Juho Kusti Paasikivi released him. He said little about the affair afterwards and earned the moniker "the silent general". The President relieved him of his duties with special permission to wear a military uniform. In his later life Airo was a member of the parliament for the National Coalition Party and a presidential elector. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he never wrote memoirs about his war experiences. In 1982 President Mauno Koivisto awarded Airo with the Grand Cross of the Finnish Order of the White Rose with swords, which was a very rare honour in Finland. He died in 1985 at his home farm.

She is known for art and architecture that combine design, biology, computing, and materials engineering. Her work embodies environmental design and digital morphogenesis, with shapes and properties that are determined by their context. She coined the phrase "material ecology" to define her work, placing materials in context. Stylistic trademarks include brightly colored and textured surfaces with structure at many scales, and composite materials whose hardness, color, and shape vary over an object. The results are often designed to be worn or touched, and inspired by nature and biology. Many of Oxman's projects use 3D printing and fabrication techniques. They include the Silk Pavilion, spun by silkworms released onto a nylon frame, Ocean Pavilion, a water-based fabrication platform that built structures out of chitosan, G3DP, the first 3D printer for glass and a set of glasswork produced by it,and collections of 3D-printed clothing and wearables worn in couture shows and by performers such as Björk. She has held regular exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art and Boston's Museum of Science, which have some of her pieces in their permanent collections. She has been recognized for contributing to new ways of thinking about making things, both within and outside of the design world. MoMA curator Paola Antonelli called her "a person ahead of her time, not of her time", and Bruce Sterling called her work "shatteringly different from anything before".

As a person, Countess Bunge aroused attention because of her way of dressing as a man, with the exception of a skirt. A lot of stories and anectodets are told about her. During the reign of Gustav III (1771–1792), the monarch noticed a peculiarly dressed woman in the Royal Swedish Opera and enquired who she was. Bunge replied "Tell His Majesty that I am the daughter of statesman Fabian Wrede and married to statesman Sven Bunge." Bunge participated in the custom in the mid 18th-century of criticizing people by anonymous poems: she is believed to have been the author of the satirical libel work Kom kära Armod lät oss vandra (Come, dear poverty, let us go) toward the notoriously stingy chamberlain Conrad Lohe. Elsa Beata Bunge died on Beateberga manor in Röö Parish in 1819.

In fact, you seem to have control over quite a big arsenal of different sorts of parody and satire that enrich your story with just the right spices. You do have control over cultural historical code, terms and dealings in such an amount that in between also my own knowledge of the field was put to a tough test. As especially delicate, I found those many parts in which you freely mix the conventions and events of myth and so-called reality. Many details I first regarded as superficial then suddenly became depth in a dazzling way. Around the story seemed to be born an almost terrifying amount of time-spatial dimension..."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luke_the_Evangelist	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antioch	Luke the Evangelist (Ancient Greek: Λουκᾶς, Loukãs) is one of the Four Evangelists—the four traditionally ascribed authors of canonical Gospels. The early church fathers ascribed to him authorship of both the Gospel according to Luke and the book of Acts of the Apostles. The authorship of The Gospel according to Luke and The Acts of the Apostles place Luke as having written a plurality of the New Testament, more even than Paul the Apostle. Prominent figures in early Christianity such as Jerome and Eusebius later reaffirmed his authorship, although the fragile evidence of the identity of the author of the works has led to discussion in scholarly circles, both secular and religious. The New Testament mentions Luke briefly a few times, and the Pauline epistle to the Colossians refers to him as a doctor; thus he is thought to have been both a physician and a disciple of Paul. Christians since the faith's early years have regarded him as a saint. He is believed to have been a martyr, reportedly as having been hanged in an olive tree, though some believe otherwise. The Roman Catholic Church and other major denominations venerate him as Saint Luke the Evangelist and as a patron saint of artists, physicians, surgeons, students and butchers; his feast day takes place on 18 October.

Hyypiä began his playing career with Ykkönen side Kumu and soon moved to Veikkausliiga outfit MyPa. He spent four years at the club, helping them win the Finnish Cup in 1992 and 1995. He moved to Willem II in 1995 and spent the next four years there. He became the team captain and was nominated their player of the year after helping them qualify for the UEFA Champions League. In 1999, he moved to Liverpool, the team he supported as a child, in a deal worth £2.6 million. He quickly established himself in the first team, partnering Stéphane Henchoz in defence. By 2001, he regularly captained the team and that season Liverpool won a slew of honours, completing a cup treble of the League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup, in addition to winning the UEFA Super Cup and FA Community Shield. He became first choice captain in the 2001–02 season and was part of the Football League Cup-winning team in 2003. Steven Gerrard superseded him as captain in 2003, but Hyypiä still occasionally captained the side in his absence. Hyypiä won his highest football honour in 2005 as part of Liverpool's victorious 2004–05 Champions League campaign, where his defensive partnership with Jamie Carragher helped them win in the final. During his ten years in Merseyside, he became a fan favourite and remains a popular figure at the club. From 2009 to 2011, Hyypiä played for German Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen, where he retired as a player in 2011. Hyypiä was a prominent figure in the Finland national team and was selected as the Finnish Sports' Journalists and Football Association Player of the Year numerous times.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paavo_Nurmi	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turku	Paavo Johannes Nurmi (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈpɑːʋo ˈnurmi] (13px listen); 13 June 1897 – 2 October 1973) was a Finnish middle- and long-distance runner. He was nicknamed the "Flying Finn" as he dominated distance running in the early 20th century. Nurmi set 22 official world records at distances between 1500 metres and 20 kilometres, and won nine gold and three silver medals in his twelve events in the Olympic Games. At his peak, Nurmi was undefeated at distances from 800 m upwards for 121 races. Throughout his 14-year career, he remained unbeaten in cross country events and the 10,000 m. Born into a working-class family, Nurmi left school at 12 to provide for his family. In 1912, he was inspired by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting national records en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After a silver medal in the 5000 m, he took gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first, and so far only, runner to hold the world record in the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m races at the same time. He went on to set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with just an hour between the races, and take gold medals in the distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Olympics. Seemingly untouched by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals, but embittered, as Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m. Struggling with injuries and motivation issues after his exhaustive U.S. tour in 1925, Nurmi found his long-time rivals Ville Ritola and Edvin Wide ever more serious challengers. At the 1928 Summer Olympics, Nurmi recaptured the 10,000 m title but was beaten for the gold in the 5000 m and the 3000 m steeplechase. He then turned his attention to longer distances, breaking the world records for events such as the one hour run and the 25-mile marathon. Nurmi intended to end his career with a marathon gold medal, as his idol Kolehmainen had done. In a controversial case that strained Finland–Sweden relations and sparked an inter-IAAF battle, Nurmi was suspended before the 1932 Games by an IAAF council that questioned his amateur status. Two days before the opening ceremonies, the council rejected his entries. Although he was never declared a professional, Nurmi's suspension became definite in 1934 and he retired from running. Nurmi later coached Finnish runners, raised funds for Finland during the Winter War, and worked as a haberdasher, building contractor, and share trader, eventually becoming one of Finland's richest people. In 1952, he was the lighter of the Olympic Flame at the Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Nurmi's speed and elusive personality spawned nicknames such as the "Phantom Finn", while his achievements, training methods and running style influenced future generations of middle and long distance runners. Nurmi, who rarely ran without a stopwatch in his hand, has been credited for introducing the "even pace" strategy and analytic approach to running, and for making running a major international sport.

Lexell made important discoveries in polygonometry and celestial mechanics; the latter led to a comet named in his honour. La Grande Encyclopédie states that he was the prominent mathematician of his time who contributed to spherical trigonometry with new and interesting solutions, which he took as a basis for his research of comet and planet motion. His name was given to a theorem of spherical triangles. Lexell was one of the most prolific members of the Russian Academy of Sciences at that time, having published 66 papers in 16 years of his work there. A statement attributed to Leonhard Euler expresses high approval of Lexell's works: "Besides Lexell, such a paper could only be written by D'Alambert or me". Daniel Bernoulli also praised his work, writing in a letter to Johann Euler "I like Lexell's works, they are profound and interesting, and the value of them is increased even more because of his modesty, which adorns great men". Lexell was unmarried, and kept up a close friendship with Leonhard Euler and his family. He witnessed Euler's death at his house and succeeded Euler to the chair of the mathematics department at the Russian Academy of Sciences, but died the following year. The asteroid 2004 Lexell is named in his honour, as is the lunar crater Lexell.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musa_Pasha_ibn_Hasan	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaza_City	Musa Pasha ibn Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn Ridwan ibn Mustafa (Arabic: موسى باشا بن حسن رضوان‎‎) was the Governor of Gaza and Jerusalem during the period of Ottoman rule in Palestine in the second half of the 17th century. His reign extended from 1663, when he succeeded his deposed and executed brother Husayn Pasha, until the late 1670s. Musa's son Ahmad Pasha succeeded his father, and was the last Ridwan governor of Gaza, serving until 1690. Although he was noted to be amiable by disposition, he established a strict regime that was much less tolerant to Gaza's Jewish and Christian communities, which had prospered under Husayn Pasha's rule. The French consul of Jerusalem at the time, Chevalier d'Arvieux believed this policy was put in place because of Musa's fears of being portrayed as pro-Christian or pro-French; his brother Husayn Pasha headed a very tolerant and successful administration and was believed to have been deposed, imprisoned and executed by the Ottoman authorities for that reason. Historian Dror Ze'evi described Musa as a "weak and unimpressive governor." After the deaths of his niece Shaqra Khatun and her husband Assaf Pasha, custody of their children Muhammad Bey, Ali Bey and Mahmanud Khanim was transferred to Musa who was put in charge of their inheritance. In 1663 Musa commissioned a restoration of the Great Mosque of Gaza and had his name inscribed on the mantle of its mihrab. Gaza still remained relatively prosperous under Musa's rule which was largely credited to the policies his predecessor Husayn Pasha put into place. The city continued to serve as the virtual capital of Palestine. However, not long after Musa's reign, Gaza's economy and political status began to decline and by the 19th century, it was no more than a small town.

Pekka Kuusisto is constantly working with musicians from many different backgrounds. He regularly performs with electronics, giving concerts consisting of mostly improvised material. During the past few years, he has frequently performed a solo recital program consisting of the Partita in D minor by Johann Sebastian Bach and electronic improvisations on funeral chorales. The traditional music of Finland serves as a source of inspiration for Kuusisto, and his approach to the violin has changed substantially since he became more involved with folk music and its performers. He has been a guest performer with groups such as Nightwish, Rinneradio, Don Johnson Big Band, The National and Salsa Dura. Pekka Kuusisto also writes music, but mostly for small ensembles where he is one of the performers. With accordionist Johanna Juhola, he wrote half of the album "Max Höjd" and half of the music for "Auf Wiedersehen Finnland", a documentary film by Virpi Suutari about Second World War events in Finnish Lapland.He composed the music for the album "Kiestinki", with lyrics written by Paula Vesala.

In classical circles, Pekka Kuusisto is internationally renowned both as soloist and director and is recognised for his fresh approach to the repertoire. A strong advocate of new music, Pekka regularly collaborates with contemporary composers and in the 2012/13 season, he gave the world premiere of Sebastian Fagerlund's Violin Concerto, written for him and commissioned by the Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra. Other recent highlights have included concerts with the Finnish Radio Symphony, Oslo Philharmonic, Swedish Chamber, Toronto Symphony and Washington’s National Symphony orchestras, as well as the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Die Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen and Konzerthausorchester Berlin. In 2013/14, Pekka joins frequent collaborators Britten Sinfonia in performances of four Britten works as part of the composer’s centenary celebrations, with choreography by the Richard Alston Dance Company. He also returns to the Cincinnati Symphony, Royal Stockholm Philharmonic, Singapore Symphony, City of Birmingham Symphony and Philharmonia orchestras. Pekka Kuusisto seeks to engage with people across the artistic spectrum, working on new interpretations of existing repertoire alongside original works. He regularly directs ensembles from the violin, including the Australian, London, Irish, Mahler and The Saint Paul chamber orchestras, as well as the Amsterdam Sinfonietta. Recent recital partners include Iiro Rantala, Anne Sofie von Otter, Angela Hewitt, Kimmo Pohjonen and Nicolas Altstaedt. He gave the world premiere of Olli Mustonen's Sonata for Violin and Piano with the composer at the Wigmore Hall in spring 2013, and later this year he tours Europe with his traditional music group, The Luomu Players. 'Our Festival', of which Pekka is Artistic Director, provides another opportunity for him to bring a number of artforms together in a single performance. Based in Sibelius’ home town, Järvenpää, it was selected as Festival of the Year by Finland Festivals in 2011. In 2013, Pekka gave the world premiere of an electronic work inspired by Magnus Lindberg’s Violin Concerto, which he co-wrote with Tuomas Norvio. He also gave duo performances with juggler Jay Gilligan, joined the vocal group Rajaton and performed with Finnish schlager legend Paula Koivuniemi. Pekka Kuusisto has enjoyed a number of prestigious residencies, including at the Aldeburgh Festival, the Concertgebouw’s Robeco Zomerconcerten, and as a ‘Junge Wilde’ artist at the Konzerthaus Dortmund. He oversaw the programming for the 2011 Avanti! Summer Sounds Festival and he continues to work regularly with Tapiola Sinfonietta, where he was formerly Artistic Partner (2006-2013). Kuusisto was featured in the film 4 as the soloist of the winter quarter of a quartet of young musicians from around the world playing Vivaldi's The Four Seasons.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cerinthus	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antioch	Cerinthus (Greek: Κήρινθος; fl. c. 100 CE) was a gnostic and to some, an early Christian, who was prominent as a heresiarch in the view of the early Church Fathers. Contrary to proto-orthodox Christianity, used the Gospel of Cerinthus, and denied that the Supreme God made the physical world. In Cerinthus' interpretation, the Christ came to Jesus at baptism, guided him in his ministry, but left him at the crucifixion. He taught that Jesus would establish a thousand-year reign of sensuous pleasure after the Second Coming but before the General Resurrection, a view that was declared heretical by the Council of Nicaea. Cerinthus used a version of the gospel of Matthew as scripture. Cerinthus taught at a time when Christianity's relation to Judaism and to Greek philosophy had not yet been clearly defined. In his association with the Jewish law and his modest assessment of Jesus, he was similar to the Ebionites and to other Jewish Christians. In defining the world's creator as the demiurge, he emulated Platonic philosophy and anticipated the Gnostics. Early Christian tradition describes Cerinthus as a contemporary to and opponent of John the Evangelist, who may have written the First Epistle of John and the Second Epistle of John to warn the less mature in faith and doctrine about the changes Cerinthus was making to the original gospel.All that is known about Cerinthus comes from the writing of his theological opponents.

Over the next eleven years, Bakshi directed seven additional animated features. He is well known for such films as Wizards (1977), The Lord of the Rings (1978), American Pop (1981) and Fire and Ice (1983).

The history of his legacy has polarized opinion, as he is known for his colossal building projects throughout Judea, including his expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem (Herod's Temple), the construction of the port at Caesarea Maritima, the fortress at Masada and Herodium. Vital details of his life are recorded in the works of the 1st century CE Roman–Jewish historian Josephus. Herod also appears in the Christian Gospel of Matthew as the ruler of Judea who orders the Massacre of the Innocents at the time of the birth of Jesus. Despite his successes, including singlehandedly forging a new aristocracy from practically nothing, he still garnered criticism from various historians. His reign polarizes opinion amongst scholars and historians, some viewing his legacy as evidence of success, or a reminder of his tyrannical rule.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdullah_Pasha_ibn_Ali	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acre,_Israel	Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali (commonly referred to simply as Abdullah Pasha; 1801–?) was the Ottoman governor (wali) of Sidon Eyalet between May 1820 and May 1832, with a nine-month interruption in 1822–23. Like his predecessors Jazzar Pasha and Sulayman Pasha, Abdullah Pasha ruled from the port city of Acre. During his reign, all of Palestine and the Syrian coastline came under his jurisdiction. Among his major military victories was his survival of an imperial-backed siege of Acre in 1822 instigated by the Farhi family in retaliation for Abdullah's execution of his mentor Haim Farhi, the suppression of revolts in Mount Lebanon and Jerusalem in 1824 and 1826, respectively, and the 1831 capture of the Sanur fortress. While Abduallah oversaw a period of relative stability in Syria, during his reign the region also experienced economic reversals and increasing poverty, while Acre's key role as an export center of Levantine cotton and olive oil increasingly diminished. Abdullah was the last governor of Sidon to rule from Acre and his defeat to the forces of Muhammad Ali of Egypt in 1832 marked the end of Acre as a political and economic power. Following his defeat, he lived in exile in Egypt and then the Hejaz, where he died.

Since al-Āmir had not named an heir when he died, the succession of al-Ḥāfiz was not uncontested - a group of Shī‘ah recognised al-Āmir's son aṭ-Ṭayyib Abī al-Qāṣim as rightful heir, leading to a new schism. Additionally, al-Afdal Shahanshah, whose father was regent to al-Mustā‘lī before he was overthrown when al-Āmir succeeded him, challenged and jailed al-Ḥāfiz and in fact ruled for a brief while before he was assassinated, presumably by supporters of al-Ḥāfiz.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chileab	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hebron	Chileab, also known as Daniel, was the second son of David, King of Israel, according to the Bible. He was David's son with his third wife Abigail, widow of Nabal the Carmelite, and is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 3:1, and 2 Samuel 3:3. Unlike the other of David's three elder sons, Amnon, Absalom, and Adonijah who were important characters in 2 Samuel, Chileab is only named in the list of David's sons and no further mention is made of him. Though being the second son, Chileab was not a contender for the throne of Israel, even after the death of the first-born Amnon, the third-born Absalom and fourth-born Adonijah. He may have died before his father. Later rabbinic traditions name him as one of four ancient Israelites who died without sin, the other three being Benjamin, Jesse and Amram . The throne eventually passed to his younger half brother, Solomon. Chileab is known as Daluyah in 2 Samuel in the Septuagint. According to Rashi, some questioned whether Abigail was pregnant through David or her first husband, Nabal; therefore, God arranged that Chileab would resemble David. It is possible his name "Chiliab," which can be translated "perfection of the father," is a reference to (or cause of) that legend.

Jortikka was the coach of the World Champion U20 national team of Finland in 1987, the tournament which is famous for the Punch-up in Piestany. He was then appointed as the assistant coach of the national team, which took Finland's first medal in men's level by finishing second in the 1988 Winter Olympics. Jortikka is best known for his success in club teams. In 1988 he took over as the head coach of TPS, leading them to three successive championships. After being eliminated in quarter-finals in 1992, Jortikka was sacked and he signed with HPK.

He has also coached Malmö IF for two non-successive seasons. In December 1995 he joined JYP as a mid-season replacement. JYP was placed last at that point and on its way to relegation games. Under Jortikka's short stint, the team escaped the relegation battle and ended the season as 11th out of 12 teams. He then regained his position as the coach of the U20 national team again but this time Finland failed to get a medal. In 1998 he returned to TPS, and led them to another triple, winning titles in 1999, 2000 and 2001. After that he took a two-season sabbatical from coaching. Jortikka became the head coach of Jokerit in 2003 and coached them for two seasons. The first season was a disappointment with Jokerit being eliminated in quarter-finals but in 2004-05 Jokerit advanced to the finals. In the regular season their goaltender Tim Thomas made a record of 15 shutouts. Jortikka once again returned to TPS for the next season but TPS was eliminated in the first playoff round in the following two seasons, therefore failing to reach the quarter-finals that were set as the goal for the season.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amin_al-Hindi	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaza_City	Amin al-Hindi (1940 – August 17, 2010) was an intelligence chief of the Palestinian Authority. Hindi was a leader of the Black September movement and was suspected of involvement in the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics that resulted in the deaths of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches. Hindi was born in Gaza in 1940 and was actively involved with Yasir Arafat in the Fatah movement that Arafat created in the 1950s. In its obituary, The New York Times described Hindi as being "widely suspected of having played an organizing role" in the Black September attack in Munich that led to the deaths of 11 athletes and coaches representing the Israeli Olympic team at the 1972 Summer Games who had been taken as hostages at the Olympic village on the morning of September 5, 1972. Israeli security forces carried out a series of killings of individuals believed to have been involved with the massacre. Hindi never acknowledged his involvement in the attack and may have been the last living person involved with plotting the attack following the death of Abu Daoud, the Palestinian terrorist known as the planner, architect and mastermind of the Munich massacre. Israel permitted him to return from exile in the 1990s following the Oslo Accords. He became a senior official in the Palestinian Authority and served as commander of the Palestinian General Security and Intelligence Service until 2005. In that role he had frequent contact with Israeli military and security forces. The Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that al-Hindi had died at age 70 on August 17, 2010, in Amman, Jordan, due to liver cancer and pancreatic cancer. His body was transported from Jordan to the West Bank where ceremonies honoring him were held at the presidential headquarters of Mahmoud Abbas. His body was then transferred through Israel for burial in Gaza. His Gaza funeral was attended by members of the Fatah Central Committee and the Fatah Revolutionary Council. A procession traveled from his home in the Al-Rimal neighborhood to the Katiba Mosque.

After nine seasons racing in Formula One, in which during his first Ferrari stint he was the 2007 World Champion, he competed in the World Rally Championship in 2010 and 2011. In 2012, he returned to Formula One, driving for Lotus and continued to drive for Lotus in 2013.

Along with rallying, Räikkönen also competed in NASCAR, and made his debut for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the Camping World Truck Series. Räikkönen made his return to F1 when he signed a 2-year deal with Lotus starting with the 2012 Formula One season. In his comeback season, he won the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. His consistent performances allowed him to end the season 3rd in the Drivers' Championship. In 2008, Räikkönen was among the two Formula One drivers who made it into Forbes magazine's The Celebrity 100 list, the other being Fernando Alonso. He was 36th on the magazine's The Celebrity 100 list of 2008, and 41st the previous year. On the same list, as of 2008, he is listed as the 26th highest-paid celebrity overall and the 5th highest-paid sportsman behind Tiger Woods, David Beckham, Michael Jordan and Phil Mickelson. In 2009, Räikkönen was listed as the 2nd highest-paid athlete in the world, behind Woods.

During the 1980s he became an international leader in the theory of self-organization and pattern formation in open systems, and later extended this work to adaptive complex systems and biocomplexity. His specialization in self-organization of complex systems yielded the breakthrough of solving the long-standing (since Kepler) snowflake problem. In the late 1980s, he turned to study of bacterial self-organization, believing that bacteria hold the key to understanding the larger biological systems. He developed new pattern forming bacteria species, became a pioneer in the study of bacterial intelligence and social behaviors of bacteria, and was an influential figure in establishing the now rapidly evolving physics of living systems (biological physics and physical biology) disciplines. He was an adviser to the Microbes Mind Forum.

Lehtinen ran a new world record in 5000 m (14:17.0) just a month prior to the Olympics, thus becoming a main favourite to the Olympic 5000 m title. In the final, the Finns Lehtinen and Lauri Virtanen led early. They managed to shake off all other competitors except Ralph Hill from the United States. Soon the race turned into a battle between Lehtinen and Hill. On the last lap, Hill tried to overtake Lehtinen. Seeing this, the Finn blocked his way, zig-zagging from one lane to the other to the great exasperation of the crowd. At the finish, Lehtinen crossed first a mere 50 centimetres ahead. Although this was a common tactic in Europe, the American audience was unaccustomed to it, so they booed. Hill declined to file a protest. They both recorded an identical time of 14:30.0. This was the only Olympic race longer than 200 metres in which the top two finishers recorded identical times. At the 1936 Summer Olympics, Lehtinen couldn't defend his title, finishing second after fellow countryman Gunnar Höckert. In 1940, Lehtinen donated his Los Angeles gold medal to a soldier who had served with distinction on the Karelian Isthmus. Lehtinen's gesture was a mark of respect for Höckert, who was killed in action on the Isthmus. In Kerkkoo village in Porvoo, there is a road named after him, "Lauri Lehtisen Tie."

Salminen is distinguished by an imposing figure and height (6' 5"); a cavernous, heavy, dark voice with a huge upper register; and an expressive face. According to one reviewer, in his prime Salminen was "... simply the largest bass voice in captivity. It is not just its roar in powering over Wagner's maximum orchestra, but the way he carves the sonority and forms the color." Salminen has a special gift for playing menacing, threatening characters. He performed as Fafner and Hagen in the PBS video broadcast Ring Cycle from the Metropolitan Opera, for the largest viewing-audience of the Ring in history. He sang in the premiere of Sallinen’s Kuningas Lear in 2000 (King Lear, title role), and Jukka Linkola's Robin Hood in 2011 (Sheriff).

He continued until 1989 adding Fafner (Rheingold, Siegfried), Daland (Der fliegende Holländer), King Marke (Tristan und Isolde), Heinrich (Lohengrin), Pogner (Meistersinger), Landgraf (Tannhäuser) and Hagen (Götterdämmerung) to his roles there. Other important roles are King Philip II (Don Carlos by Giuseppe Verdi), the Grand Inquisitor in the same work, Seneca in L'Incoronazione di Poppea, Sarastro in Die Zauberflöte, the Commendatore in Don Giovanni, the title role in Boris Godunov and Ivan Khovansky in Khovanshchina. He also performs in sacred music and concert recitals. Salminen is a widely video-taped singing actor with three different performances as Hagen available on DVD; also two performances as the Commendatore, several as Sarastro, two as Hunding and two as Daland. Videotaped performances and films are also available as King Phillip II, the Grand Inquisitor, Seneca, Gurnemanz, Pogner, and Boris Godunov.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yuval_Levin	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haifa	Yuval Levin is an American political analyst, public intellectual, academic and journalist who is the founding Editor of National Affairs. He has been called "probably the most influential conservative intellectual of the Obama era", while The New Republic has dubbed Levin "the right's new Irving Kristol." Levin is also a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C. In 2005 and 2006, he was a member of the White House domestic policy staff. He is the former chief of staff of the President's Council on Bioethics, a former Congressional staffer, contributing editor to National Review and the Weekly Standard, and one of the founders of The New Atlantis, where he still remains as a Senior Editor. He is the author of Tyranny of Reason: The Origins and Consequences of the Social Scientific Outlook (ISBN 9780761818724), Imagining the Future: Science and American Democracy (ISBN 9781594032097), The Great Debate: Edmund Burke, Thomas Paine, and the Birth of Right and Left (ISBN 9780465050970), The Fractured Republic: Renewing America’s Social Contract in the Age of Individualism (ISBN 9780465061969), and of numerous essays and articles dealing largely with political theory, science, technology, and public policy. On the relationship between political theory and public policy, Levin has said: "For me, these things are very deeply connected. I think politics really is rooted in political philosophy, is much better understood when it’s understood in light of political philosophy. And that a lot of the policy debates we have make much more sense if you see that people are arguing about two ways of understanding what the human person is, what human society is, and especially what the liberal society is. The left and right in our country are both liberal, they both believe in the free society, but they mean something very different by that." Conservatism, Levin has said, "understands society not as just individuals and government, but thinks of it in terms of everything that happens in between. That huge space between the individual and the state is where society actually is. And that’s where families are, it’s where communities are, it’s where the market economy is." Levin was trained in political science at American University and earned a PhD from the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torsten_Stålhandske	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Porvoo	Torsten Stålhandske (Porvoo, Finland, 1 September 1593 – Haderslev, 21 April 1644) – Swedish for "Torsten Steelglove", sometimes written "Stålhansch" in the Swedish of the times , and referred to in German literature as Torsten Staalhansch, was a Finnish officer in the Swedish army during the Thirty Years' War. The son of Torsten Svensson (Stålhandske), a noble military officer of Swedish ancestry from Western Götaland, and Carin Lydiksdotter Jägerhorn, of Finnish nobility from southern Finland, Torsten Stålhandske married Kristina Horn in 1643. Albeit a short man, he was exceptionally strong; when a captured enemy officer, particularly a Pole or an Austrian was led into the Swedish camp, he would shake their hands so hard that blood would appear under their fingernails in what he called "an honest Swedish handshake". Hence, his nickname. Stålhandske started his military career as a squire to Patrick Ruthwen, with whom he had a task of recruiting military in Scotland. He followed Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden to Prussia, as an Ensign in his Personal guard in 1626. In the same year he was promoted to the rank of Major in the Regiment of Arvid Horn. In 1627 he joined the cavalry led by Åke Henriksson Tott. In 1629 he was promoted to Lieutenant-colonel in the Nylands och Tavastehus Cavalry regiment, leading Finnish horsemen, also known as Hakkapeliitat, for the first time into the Thirty Years' War. At the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631) they rode with the right wing personally led by King Gustavus Adolphus. In 1632 he was promoted to the rank of Colonel. At the siege of Nuremberg he assaulted the "invincible warriors" of Austrian Colonel Cronberg and, thanks to his mighty and successful charges, largely determined the outcome of the Battle of Lützen, where Gustavus Adolphus was killed, the battle was nonetheless won. In June 1634, Stålhandske was wounded at the Battle of Hamelin. In 1635, a Major-general, he joined the main army led by Banér. At the Battle of Wittstock he personally captured 35 flags and, at a critical juncture of the battle, forced the enemy to flee. Similarly, he distinguished himself at the Battle of Chemnitz as well as in Silesia, where he defended his positions during the whole year of 1640 against Count Mansfeld. Finally, in April 1642, he joined his forces with Torstenson's Army and took part in the Second Battle of Breitenfeld (also known as the First Battle of Leipzig), where he was seriously wounded. In May he was appointed general in Chief of the Cavalry. In 1643 Stålhandske followed Torstenson in Bohemia. In 1644 he crushed a hostile army corps in the Jutland, but then fell ill and died in Haderslev on 21 April 1644. Torsten Stålhandske's mausoleum can be seen in the Cathedral of Turku (Finland).

Grimaldi was a relative of the Carracci family, under whom it is presumed he first apprenticed. He was afterwards a pupil of Cardinal Francesco Albani. He went to Rome, and was appointed architect to Pope Paul V and also patronized by succeeding popes. Towards 1648 he was invited to France by Cardinal Mazarin, and for about two years was employed in buildings for that minister and for Louis XIV, and in fresco-painting in the Louvre. His colour was strong, somewhat excessive in the use of green; his touch light. He painted history, portraits and landscapes—the, last with predilection, especially in his advanced years—and executed engravings and etchings from his own landscapes and from those of Titian and the Caracci. Returning to Rome, he was made principe (director) of the Accademia di San Luca; and in that city he died, in high repute not only for his artistic skill but for his upright and charitable deeds. His son Alessandro assisted him both in painting and in engraving. Paintings by Grimaldi are preserved in the Palazzo del Quirinale and in the Vatican, and in the church of San Martino ai Monti; there is also a series of his landscapes in the Palazzo Colonna. His mistress was Elena Aloisi, daughter of the painter Baldassare Aloisi.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cesare_Candi	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bologna	Candi, Cesare - (b Minerbio, near Bologna, 5 March 1869; d Genoa, 29 Sept 1947). Italian maker of violins, mandolins, guitars and other string instruments. In 1884, after his father's death, he went to work with his brother Oreste Candi (1865–1938) at the workshop of Raffaele Fiorini in Bologna. Around 1888 he again joined his brother, who now worked for the Fratelli Barberis, a mandolin and guitar making firm, in Genoa. Cesare set up on his own around 1892 and later began to make violins, probably having learned from Eugenio Praga (1847–1901) and Enrico Rocca (1847–1915), who were also working in Genoa. Candi's style, which underwent slight but significant changes in the course of his long career, is easily recognizable. His work is clean, if at times a little ‘cold’. He used a very personal building technique which he later passed on to his many students. An unusual aspect of his violin making technique was his use of linings cut from one piece of wood (like a guitar) that passed over the blocks. The channelling is always very deep and marked (at times even exaggerated). The varnish is generally yellow gold or red-orange in colour, and of variable consistency. He used two different labels during his career, and a brand, c. candi genova, which is usually inside the instrument. He made many elaborately inlaid instruments (violins, guitars, violas d'amore, etc.) with great technical skill and taste; these have been rather more appreciated by collectors than players. He received prizes at the exhibitions in Milan (1906), Bologna (1907) and Cremona (1937). In occasion of Stradivari's celebrations in 1937 he restored the 'Il Cannone' of Paganini. Candi left a permanent imprint on both professional and amateur 20th-century Genoese violin making.Cesare Candi's students include Paolo de Barbieri, Giuseppe, B. Lecchi and his grandson Corrado Gritti (Candi). Paolo de Barbieri entered Candi’s workshop when he was about 30, having previously been a sailor and soldier. He learnt external mould construction from Candi, as well as the use of continuous linings, which he employed throughout his life. He made more than 360 violins, as well as violas, cellos and guitars. In his early period he used his master’s Strad model, followed later by a personal Strad model with narrow f-holes and round archings; but his main model was the 'Cannon’ Guarneri ‘del Gesù’, which since Praga had been a steady reference for all Genoese makers. De Barbieri’s place in Candi’s workshop was taken in 1924 by a talented young woodworker called Giuseppe Bernardo Lecchi (1895–1967), originally from a southern Piedmontese village. Lecchi proved the ideal partner for Candi and made a considerable contribution to his last series of decorated instruments, taking charge of the delicate inlays. When in 1937 he won first prize for a quartet at the Stradivari bicentennial exhibition in Cremona, Lecchi was at his peak. His was a more ‘classical’ taste than that of all the other Genoese makers, and his way of making the Stradivari model was elegant and well balanced. Most of his violins don’t bear the sharp edges and consistent archings of modern Genoese instruments. Lecchi used Candi’s continuous lining technique only in his early period; soon after he began making the interiors in the traditional way, with the central linings mortised or simply set into the centre-blocks.

His career began in Italian Formula Alfa Boxer in 1987 and continued for 15 years. His only championship win was the 1992 Italian Formula Three title. Following that win he also raced German Formula Three (1993–1995), Macau Grand Prix for Formula 3 (1996), FIA GT Championship (1997–1998) and American Le Mans Series (1999–2002). Angelelli is nicknamed the Axe because he has a knack of closing up and "chopping" off seconds behind the leader quickly in a race to set himself up to make a clean pass for the win. Angelelli had a banner year in 2005. Angelelli and teammate Wayne Taylor won the 24 Hours of Daytona and captured the 2005 Grand American Daytona Prototype championship. Angelelli was selected to run in the 2006 IROC series in America, along with teammate Wayne Taylor, becoming the first tandem in IROC history. Angelelli is also known for being the safety car driver in the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. Ayrton Senna followed Angelelli's safety car for 5 laps before his fatal accident. For the past several years, Angelelli has driven for the Wayne Taylor Sun Trust Racing Team in the Daytona Prototype class of the Grand Am Racing Series, a class that requires two drivers per car. He has teamed up with Ricky Taylor, the son of team owner Wayne Taylor. For 2013 Angelelli was again with Wayne Taylor Racing/Velocity Worldwide but Taylor's son Ricky had left to pursue another driving opportunity. This left a driver vacancy on the team which was quickly filled by Taylor's younger son Jordan. Together Jordan and Angelelli made a potent combination and won the final Grand-Am Driver's Title, narrowly beating Scott Pruett and Memo Rojas who had won the championship 4 of the previous 5 years.

He is often credited as the inventor of radio, and he shared the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun "in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy". Marconi was an entrepreneur, businessman, and founder of The Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company in the United Kingdom in 1897 (which became the Marconi Company). He succeeded in making a commercial success of radio by innovating and building on the work of previous experimenters and physicists. In 1929, the King of Italy ennobled Marconi as a Marchese (marquis).	
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marcello_Malpighi	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bologna	Marcello Malpighi (10 March 1628 – 29 November 1694) was an Italian biologist and physician, who is referred to as the "Father of microscopical anatomy, histology, physiology and embryology". Malpighi's name bears to several physiological features related to the biological excretory system, such as the Malpighian corpuscles and Malpighian pyramids of the kidneys and the Malpighian tubule system of insects. The splenic lymphoid nodules are often called the "Malpighian bodies of the spleen" or Malpighian corpuscles. The botanical family Malpighiaceae is also named after him. He was the first person to see capillaries in animals, and he discovered the link between arteries and veins that had eluded William Harvey and Malpighi has been the earliest person to observe red blood cells under a microscope. His treatise De polypo cordis (1666) was important for understanding blood composition, as well as how blood clots. In it, Malpighi described how the form of a blood clot differed in the right against the left sides of the heart. The use of the microscope enabled Malpighi to discover that invertebrates do not use lungs to breathe, but small holes in their skin called tracheae. Malpighi also studied the anatomy of the brain and concluded this organ is a gland. In terms of modern endocrinology, this deduction is correct because the hypothalamus of the brain has long been recognized for its hormone-secreting capacity. Because Malpighi had a wide knowledge of both plants and animals, he made contributions to the scientific study of both. The Royal Society of London published two volumes of his botanical and zoological works in 1675 and 1679. Another edition followed in 1687, and a supplementary volume in 1697. In his autobiography, Malpighi speaks of his Anatome Plantarum, decorated with the engravings of Robert White as "the most elegant format in the whole literate world." His study of plants led him to conclude that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm (using his microscope, he probably saw the stomata, through which plants exchange carbon dioxide with oxygen). Malpighi observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he correctly interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves, and being blocked above the ring.	
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Benedict_XIV	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bologna	Pope Benedict XIV (Latin: Benedictus XIV; 31 March 1675 – 3 May 1758), born Prospero Lorenzo Lambertini, served as the Pope of the Catholic Church from 17 August 1740 to his death in 1758. Perhaps one of the greatest scholars in Christendom, yet often overlooked, he promoted scientific learning, the baroque arts, reinvigoration of Thomism, and the study of the human form. Firmly established with great devotion and adherence to the Council of Trent and authentic Catholic teaching, Benedict removed changes previously made to the Breviary, sought peacefully to reverse growing secularism in certain European courts, invigorated ceremonies with great pomp, and throughout his life and his reign, published numerous theological treatises. In terms of the governance of the Papal States, he reduced taxation and also encouraged agriculture. He also supported free trade. A scholar, he laid the groundwork for the present Vatican Museum. Benedict XIV, to an extent can be considered a polymath due to his numerous studies of ancient literature, the publishing of ecclesiastical books and documents, the study of the human body, and his great devotion to art and theology. Horace Walpole described him as "a priest without insolence or interest, a prince without favorites, a pope without nephews."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pietro_Cataldi	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bologna	Pietro Antonio Cataldi (15 April 1548, Bologna – 11 February 1626, Bologna) was an Italian mathematician. A citizen of Bologna, he taught mathematics and astronomy and also worked on military problems. His work included the development of continued fractions and a method for their representation. He was one of many mathematicians who attempted to prove Euclid's fifth postulate. Cataldi discovered the sixth and seventh primes later to acquire the designation Mersenne primes by 1588. His discovery of the 6th, that corresponding to p=17 in the formula Mp=2p-1, exploded a many-times repeated number-theoretical myth (Until Cataldi, 19 authors going back to Nicomachus are reported to have made the claim in L.E.Dickson's History of the Theory of Numbers—with a few more repeating this afterward) that the perfect numbers had units digits that invariably alternated between 6 and 8; and that of the 7th (for p=19) held the record for the largest known prime for almost two centuries, until Leonhard Euler discovered that 231 - 1 was the eighth Mersenne prime. Although Cataldi also claimed that p=23, 29, 31 and 37 all also generate Mersenne primes (and perfect numbers), his text's clear demonstration shows that he had genuinely established the fact through p=19.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stefano_Pozzi	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bologna	Stefano Pozzi (9 November 1699 (1707?) — 11 June 1768) was an Italian painter, designer, draughtsman and decorator whose career was spent largely in Rome. Born in Rome, he was one of four artist sons of his father, an innkeeper: Rocco (1701–74) was an engraver, with whom Stefano worked on occasion; Andrea (1718–69), a carver in ivory; Giuseppe (1723–65) was also a painter. Stefano Pozzi studied in the ateliers of two best followers of Carlo Maratta, that of Andrea Procaccini, who departed for Spain in 1720, and then Agostino Masucci. In 1732 Stefano was admitted to the Pontifical Academy of Fine Arts and Letters of the Virtuosi al Pantheon and became its Regent in 1739. In 1736, he was admitted to the Accademia di San Luca, the artist guild in Rome. Pozzi worked primarily for Roman churches; for example, he painted a Blessed Niccolò Albergati for a chapel of the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore; eight ovals between the windows (c. 1736) for the church of San Silvestro al Quirinale (Titi 1763); the refectory of the Church of San Gregorio Nazareno; a Death of St Joseph (1742) for the third chapel of the Church of Santissimo Nome di Maria (Titi 1763). He frescoed a Sant'Apollinare in Gloria in the vault of the church of Sant'Apollinare alle Terme, which was rebuilt by Ferdinando Fuga and rededicated in 1748. Among the flock of artists who worked on the Chapel of Pope Sixtus V, he contributed figures of angels in the spandrels of arches (Titi 1763). In 1744 he was summoned to Naples by Cardinal Giuseppe Spinelli to decorate the apse of the Cathedral restored by Paolo Posi; for the right wall he painted the large oil of SS Januarius and Agrippino Driving out the Saracens (still in place) and on the vault, a fresco of a choir of Angels (still in place). In subsequent commissions, he worked with the architect Luigi Vanvitelli: in 1744 he produced two paintings for the Montemorcino monastery that Vanvitelli had built for the Olivetans at Perugia (now the Palazzo dell’ Università): an Annunciation (still in place) and the Blessed Bernardino Tolomei among the Plague-stricken (Santa Francesca Romana in Rome). In Perugia he frescoed the sacristy of the Church of il Gesù. For the library that Vanvitelli designed for the Palazzo Sciarra–Colonna in Rome, Pozzi painted allegories of the Signs of the Zodiac, and in Palazzo Doria-Pamphilj he decorated the Saletto degli Specchi. Architects Vincenzo Brenna, Giacomo Quarenghi and painter Antonio Cavallucci trained in classic painting at Pozzi workshop. The picture  Madonna surrounded by angels and clouds  has been recently attributed to him by Dr. Stella Rudolph. Pozzi died in Rome in 1768.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Popoff	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Berlin	Peter Popoff (born July 2, 1946) is a German-born American televangelist, fraudulent faith healer, and self-proclaimed prophet. He initially rose to prominence in the 1980s, conducting revival meetings and hosting a nationally-televised program, during which he performed seemingly miraculous cures on audience members. After an electronics expert demonstrated in 1986 that his "divine" revelations were being fed to him by his wife via a wireless radio transmitter, Popoff declared bankruptcy the following year. He has since resumed his faith healing sessions "in a manner identical to his method prior to his exposure as a fraud", despite being exposed once again in 2007. Researcher and bioethics expert Fred M. Frohock cited Popoff as "one of many egregious instances of fake healing." Ole Anthony of the Trinity Foundation, which has investigated televangelists since 1987, said, "Most of these guys are fooled by their own theology", referring to other televangelists he considers scammers, including Joel Osteen and T. D. Jakes; but in the case of Popoff, "He's fundamentally evil, because he knows he's a con man."

He began his career rewriting scripts while working for Columbia Pictures, which led him to London where he worked with United Artists. There he wrote the screenplay for the 1969 film Women in Love (1969) and earned an Academy Award nomination for his work. Kramer introduced a controversial and confrontational style in his novel Faggots (1978), which book earned mixed reviews but emphatic denunciations from elements within the gay community for Kramer's one-sided portrayal of shallow, promiscuous gay relationships in the 1970s. Kramer witnessed the spread of the disease later known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) among his friends in 1980. He co-founded the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC), which has become the world's largest private organization assisting people living with AIDS. Kramer grew frustrated with bureaucratic paralysis and the apathy of gay men to the AIDS crisis, and wished to engage in further action than the social services GMHC provided. He expressed his frustration by writing a play titled The Normal Heart, produced at The Public Theater in New York City in 1985. His political activism continued with the founding of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) in 1987, an influential direct action protest organization with the aim of gaining more public action to fight the AIDS crisis.

A versatile character actor, McQueeney appeared in guest roles on such television series as Bonanza, Lawman, The Alaskans, 77 Sunset Strip, and Gunsmoke.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Mayer	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bridgeport,_Connecticut	John Clayton Mayer (/ˈmeɪ.ər/; born October 16, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer. He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and raised in nearby Fairfield. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, but disenrolled and moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs—refining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest Festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and then Columbia Records, which released his first EP, Inside Wants Out. His following two full-length albums—Room for Squares (2001) and Heavier Things (2003)—did well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the single "Your Body Is a Wonderland". Though Mayer started his career mainly performing acoustic rock, he began moving towards the blues genre that had originally influenced him as a musician. By 2005, he was collaborating with blues artists such as B. B. King, Buddy Guy, and Eric Clapton. Forming the John Mayer Trio, he released a live album in 2005 called Try!, and his third studio album Continuum in 2006. Both albums received wide critical acclaim, and Continuum earned Mayer a 2007 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for "Waiting on the World to Change". That album was followed by Battle Studies in 2009, a return to pop, with a number-one grossing tour. After having several controversial incidents with the media, Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and began work on a follow-up album, called Born and Raised, that would draw inspiration from the 1970s pop music of Laurel Canyon. However, the discovery of a granuloma on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012, and ultimately forced him to cancel the planned tour. Even so, the album enjoyed a generally favorable reception, though was less commercially successful than his previous work. After extensive treatments for his vocal problems—and a two-year hiatus—Mayer began performing as a singer again in January 2013, and that year released the album, Paradise Valley. The album is named for where he lives in Montana and features country music influences. By 2014, he had sold a total of over 20 million albums worldwide. After developing an interest in the Grateful Dead and connecting with Bob Weir, Mayer joined Dead & Company, who commenced a well-received tour of the Eastern U.S. that began in October 2015 and continue to tour in 2016. Mayer's secondary career pursuits extend to television hosting, comedy, and writing; he has authored columns for magazines such as Esquire. He supports various causes and has performed at charity benefits. He is a watch aficionado (with a collection he values in the "tens of millions" of dollars), and has been on the jury at the Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève. He currently lives in Montana.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Graziano	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bridgeport,_Connecticut	Michael Steven Anthony Graziano (born 1967) is an American scientist and novelist who is currently a professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Princeton University. His scientific research focuses on the brain basis of awareness. He has proposed the "attention schema" theory, an explanation of how, and for what adaptive advantage, brains attribute the property of awareness to themselves. His previous work focused on how the cerebral cortex monitors the space around the body and controls movement within that space. Notably he has suggested that the classical map of the body in motor cortex, the homunculus, is not correct and is better described as a map of complex actions that make up the behavioral repertoire. His publications on this topic have had a widespread impact among neuroscientists but have also generated controversy. His novels rely partly on his background in psychology and are known for surrealism or magic realism. Graziano also composes music including symphonies and string quartets. He is an avid practitioner of ventriloquism and uses a dummy monkey "Kevin" as sidekick.

An independent oval race driver, Adema won a record setting number of races from 1970 to 1975, all while riding on one of his modified Sno-Jets, each of which were ThunderJets models. Collaborating with Sno-Jet's Advanced Research Team in 1970, Adema tested and advised on how to improve the new ThunderJet racer which, at the time, was unstable and not competitive. His effort helped the design team develop the 1972 oval track racing sled, which was initially met with poor reception. Its flat silhouette was mockingly dubbed "roadkill" or "ThunderChicken". After winning several races in which he hung to the inside of the track while others were wasting in the banks, he started a trend later adopted by many competitors. Adema won the Kawartha Cup in 1972. His company Belmont Engineering introduced many technological features to the sport, including lightweight alloys, tungsten studs and runners, tapered tunnel for snow clearance, extra low centre of gravity and offset engine placement, and ergonomic steering and several safety features like twin density foam seats that prevented high g-force impact on a racer's spine when a bump was hit at high speed.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angelo_Michele_Bartolotti	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bologna	Angelo Michele Bartolotti (died before 1682) was an Italian guitarist, theorbo player and composer. Bartolotti was probably born in Bologna as he describes himself as "Bolognese" on the title page of his first guitar book and "di Bologna" on the title page of his second. His early career was probably spent in Florence, possibly in the service of Jacopo Salviati, Duke of Giuliano. He was amongst a group of Italian musicians invited to the Court of Queen Christina of Sweden in the early 1650s. There are records of his employment there in 1652 and 1654. On her abdication in 1655, Christina lived in Rome and Bartolotti was probably employed in her service there. In 1658 she travelled to Paris and it is possible that Bartolotti accompanied her. He seems to have settled there and lived there until his death sometime before 1682. During his years in Italy, he published at least two collections of guitar music: Libro primo di chitarra spagnola (Florence, 1640) and Secondo libro di chitarra (Rome, ca. 1655). The first book contains a cycle of passacaglias in all major and minor keys, employing a combination of battute and pizzicato styles, influenced by earlier Italian guitarists such as Giovanni Paolo Foscarini; the book also includes a ciaccona, a follia and six suites each comprising an Allemanda, Corente and Sarabanda. The second book is French-influenced, with more emphasis on pizzicato writing. Three more pieces are attributed to him in manuscripts. Bartolotti's oeuvre comprises some of the most carefully notated (with precise indications for various playing styles, ornaments, etc.) and advanced guitar music of the period. In France, however, he was best known as a theorbo player, praised by Constantijn Huygens and René Ouvrard. His treatise on theorbo accompaniment (Table pour apprendre facilement à toucher le théorbe sur la basse-continuë (Paris, 1669) is among the best 17th-century sources on the subject.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ken_Medema	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Rapids,_Michigan	Ken Medema (born Kenneth Peter Medema on December 7, 1943, in Grand Rapids, Michigan) is a composer-singer-songwriter who has been performing in the United States, Canada, and Europe for more than forty years. Some of his best known songs began as live improvisations. Ken Medema was born almost blind; his eyes let him tell light from shadow and see outlines of major objects. He began playing the piano when he was five years old, and three years later began taking lessons in classical music through braille music, playing by ear and improvising in different styles. In 1969, he majored in music therapy at Michigan State University in Lansing, studying both piano and voice. Afterwards he worked as a music therapist in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and later at Essex County Hospital in New Jersey. In 1973, he began performing and recording his own songs while at Essex County Hospital. "I had a bunch of teenagers who were really hurting," he says, "and I started writing songs about their lives. Then I thought, 'Why don't you start writing songs about your Christian life?' So I started doing that, and people really responded." His lyrics generally provide social commentary on themes such as justice, hunger, poverty, homelessness, and Christian charity as it pertains to them. He has published a total of 26 albums, the first of which he recorded for Word and Shawnee Press, and then went on to found Brier Patch Music in 1985. Through Brier Patch Music, he organizes and schedules his events, as well as publishes his music. The business was named after Brer Rabbit's home in the legendary Uncle Remus stories. "Brer Rabbit lived in a place not comfortable for anyone else," Medema says, "and we decided to follow him there." Performances regularly include songs improvised both musically and lyrically by accepting audience recommendations, sermon topics, or guest speaker stories as their basis. He performs in national and worldwide (church) congregations, campuses, youth gatherings, and annual assemblies. He lives near San Francisco, California, with his wife Jane. They have been married since 1965 and have two grown children and two grandchildren.

Coriolano was a traditional woodblock printer who followed the German style in printing. He was successful and popular, though not an innovator in the technique of woodblock printing. Eventually, he came to the attention of Pope Urban VII who granted Coriolano knighthood, as a "Roman count", and a pension.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guido_Guinizelli	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bologna	Guido Guinizelli (c. 1230–1276), born in Bologna, in present-day Emilia-Romagna, Northern Italy, was an Italian poet and 'founder' of the Dolce Stil Novo. He was the first to write in this new style of poetry writing, and thus is held to be the ipso facto founder. The famous Florentine poet Dante Alighieri considered himself to be a disciple of Guinizelli: ...quand' io odo nomar sé stesso il padremio e de li altri miei miglior che mairime d'amor usar dolci e leggiadre...(Purgatorio, XXVI 97-98). The main themes of the Dolce Stil Novo can be found in Guinizelli's Al cor gentil rempaira sempre amore: the angelic beauty of the beloved women, the comparison of nobility to the sun and the rampant use of topoi such as cor gentil and Amore. Guinizelli's poetry can be briefly described as a conciliation between divine and earthly love with deep psychological introspection. His major works are Al cor gentil rempaira sempre Amore (Within the gentle heart abideth Love), which Peter Dronke considers "perhaps the most influential love-song of the thirteenth century" (Dronke 1965, 57), as well as Io vogli[o] del ver la mia donna laudare and Vedut'ho la lucente stella Diana.

Often backing up Patrick Ewing (who joined the team in 1985-86, Wilkins would only start in 29 of the 296 contests he played for the Knickerbockers. When Pat Riley came to New York, Wilkins was released. He went to Italy for one season (1991–92, joining Ranger Varese), before returning to the NBA the next season, signing a 2-year deal with the Philadelphia 76ers. Towards the end of the 1992-93 season, on April 15, 1993, the Sixers were playing the Orlando Magic, who were led by rookie Shaquille O'Neal. On a rebound attempt, Wilkins and O'Neal collided and became entangled. Wilkins tore his achilles tendon, missing the remainder of the season. His career was effectively ended. In 1989, he established the Eddie Lee Wilkins Foundation, which later became the Eddie Lee Wilkins Youth Association. With the help of program director David Archer, Jr., Wilkins and the association began providing athletic and social intervention activities for youth in the Cartersville and North Georgia area. Wilkins currently runs a youth basketball league in Smyrna, Georgia for youth boys ages 4 – 6.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Command	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Rapids,_Michigan	James Dalton Command (October 15, 1928 – August 10, 2014) was an American professional baseball player and scout. He had two separate trials with the 1954–55 Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball, starting four games as a third baseman in July 1954, and he also served as a pinch hitter and pinch runner, playing in a total of 14 big league games. However, he was a versatile performer during a 14-season (1947–1959; 1962) minor league career, playing all the infield positions, the outfield, and, late in his career, converting to catcher. Command batted left-handed, threw right-handed, stood 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighed 205 pounds (93 kg). He was in his eighth year in the Phillies' farm system when he received his first MLB opportunity in the midst of the 1954 season. After going hitless in his first four at bats as a pinch hitter and substitute third baseman, he started his first Major League game on July 11, 1954, against the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field. Although he drew a base on balls against Carl Erskine, Command was still hitless in seven plate appearances as a Major Leaguer when he came to bat in the top half of the eighth inning with two outs, the bases loaded and the Phillies trailing 7–3. "[Dodgers' manager] Walter Alston went to the mound to ask Erskine what the — he knew about this rookie batter, Command. When Erskine told him he didn't know anything, Alston said 'Screw it, just pitch to him,'" Command told the Grand Rapids Press in 2009. Command proceeded to belt Erskine's offering for a grand slam home run to tie the game at seven; it was his first hit and only homer in the Majors. (And the Phillies would lose the game, 8–7.) In his next two starts, the second game of that July 11 doubleheader and on July 15 against the Cincinnati Redlegs at Crosley Field, Command would collect three more hits (including a double) and two more runs batted in — and that three-game flurry accounted for his entire Major League production. In all, he made four hits in 23 at bats during his two stints with Philadelphia. Command continued his playing career at the top level of the minors. While a member of the 1956 Miami Marlins, he caught legendary pitcher Satchel Paige. When his playing career ended, Command was a longtime scout for the Detroit Tigers, spending 36 years with them and contributing to two world championship teams.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francesca_Pasquali	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bologna	Francesca Pasquali (born 1980) studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in her native Bologna. Pasquali‘s work can be divided into several cycles of work, recognisable by their titles that often refer to the materials used, as with the Straws series. Cut to different lengths, innumerable plastic straws are attached to wooden panels – or more recently to mirror-polished Plexiglas – to create a vibrating surface. In the Frappe series, Pasquali experiments with neoprene, assembling layers of the material into spirals which are then mounted onto wooden panels or metal nets. Works from the Bristles series consist of plastic broom bristles assembled into wooden containers and arranged to form a soft, compact surface. More recently, the artist has been experimenting with long, uncut, plastic bristles, in particular with the site-specific installation Francesca Pasquali for Salvatore Ferragamo travelling to Milan and London in 2016. Pasquali’s work is also characterised by a sensitivity to materiality, experimenting with various materials including plastic, marble and bread and the artist often works to commissions, marrying the specificities of her practice with the particularities of the request. In 2013, alongside several Italian artists and curator Ilaria Bignotti, Francesca Pasquali founded the artistic and cultural movement Resilienza italiana, which aims to further the international debate around sculpture among contemporary and emerging artists. A finalist of the Cairo Prize in 2015 and the recipient of the second prize at the Henraux Foundation Prize in 2014, Francesca Pasquali has been invited to participate in several major international art fairs such as Art Basel in Miami and Hong Kong, FIAC in Paris, TEFAF in Maastricht, Art First in Bologna and MiArt in Milan. Her works are housed in important private collections and several public institutions throughout Italy and abroad. In December 2015, the Francesca Pasquali Archive was founded with the help of Ilaria Bignotti, the scientific director, in order to archive, preserve and promote the artist’s works through different projects with public and private institutions, as well as to present her research through innovative systems of communication.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Azo_of_Bologna	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bologna	Azo wrote glosses on all parts of the Corpus Iuris Civilis.

The Summa Codicis, and Apparatus ad codicim, collected by his pupil, Alessandro de Santo Aegidio, and amended by Hugolinus and Odofredus, formed a methodical exposition of Roman law. As one of the very few medieval legal texts in Latin, the Summa Codicis has been translated into Old French. Azo's works enjoyed great authority among generations of continental lawyers, such that it used to be said, Chi non ha Azzo, non vada al palazzo, roughly translated: "Who hasn't Azo on his side, will not go to court", neither as a plaintiff nor as judge. Azo's Summa Codicis, was also used (and often copied verbatim) by Henry Bracton in his account of English law. Azo's many glosses were ultimately incorporated into the Great Gloss of his pupil, Accursius.

In 2016 Mayweather peaked as BoxRec's number one pound for pound fighter of all time; as well as the greatest welterweight of all time. In 2016, ESPN ranked Mayweather as the greatest pound for pound boxer of the last 25 years. Many sporting news and boxing websites rated Mayweather as the best pound for pound boxer in the world twice in a span of ten years, including The Ring, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, BoxRec, Fox Sports, and Yahoo! Sports. Mayweather topped the Forbes and Sports Illustrated lists of the 50 highest-paid athletes of 2012 and 2013 respectively, and the Forbes list again in both 2014 and 2015, listing him as the highest paid athlete in the world. In 2007, he founded Mayweather Promotions, his own boxing promotional firm after defecting from Bob Arum's Top Rank.

He worked for Aldus Manutius, designing that printer's more important typefaces, including the first italic type. His romans show a degree of abstraction from calligraphy not present in the work of the earlier master Nicolas Jenson, while his italic and Greek types are notably cursive. Just as Manutius had achieved a monopoly on italic printing and Greek publishing with the permission of the Venetian government, he had a falling-out with Griffo. In 1516, after he returned to Bologna, Griffo was charged with the murder of his son-in-law, who had been beaten to death with an iron bar. This is his last appearance in the historical record. He is presumed to have been executed.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giovanni_Andrea_Donducci	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bologna	Giovanni Andrea Donducci (1575–1655), also known as Mastelletta, was an Italian Baroque painter of the Bolognese School (painting). His father was a maker of vats (mastelli). Born in Bologna, he trained in the Carracci Academy degli Incamminati at about the time when Domenichino, Lucio Massari, and perhaps Albani were there. He belongs to the generation of Carracci- inspired or trained painters comprised by Giacomo Cavedone (1577–1660); Alessandro Tiarini (1577–1668), Lucio Massari, Lionello Spada (1576=1622), and Lorenzo Garbieri. Art biographer Malvasia claims he befriended the Genoese Agostino Tassi while in Rome. Between 1613-1614, he contributed to the decoration of the chapel of Saint Dominic in the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna. On the right side of the chapel The Miracle of the Forty Drowned (1613) and on the left side the canvas Resurrection of the young Napoleone Orsini (1614). He also frescoed the patron saints of Bologna on the pendentives of the dome: San Floriano, St. Francis, San Procolo and San Petronio. Malvasia describes him by the late 1620s as increasingly neurotic and reclusive: “an enemy of his friends, suspicious of everyone, hating himself, in other words". His figures have an almost phantasmagoric Alessandro Magnasco-like fervor, not characteristic of Bolognese classicism. He is also painted elaborate landscapes to his paintings, likely an influence of Scarsellino's and/or Niccolò dell'Abbate's works.

Tracy Seyfert is a former Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, representing the 5th District from 1997 through her resignation in 2000. Seyfert attended Mountain View Joint Schools. She earned her undergraduate degree from Villa Maria College (now part of Gannon University), her M.A. from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, and a Ph.D. from University of Pittsburgh in 1988. She worked as a psychologist before joining the Erie County, Pennsylvania Council. Seyfert won election in 1996, running on her experience as a member of the Erie County, Pennsylvania Council and her pledge to reduce the size of the Pennsylvania state government. On September 9, 1999, federal and state investigators raided Seyfert's home, located in "Tracy's Ridge" in Millcreek Township, Pennsylvania, and seized a 10-ton (1,500 kilowatt) generating unit and 500-gallon oil tank. New units of that size cost $160,000 and require a crane and flatbed truck to move and are capable of supplying power to a coal mine, a lumber yard, or emergency power to the USX Tower. The total value of the units was less than $1,000. Prosecutors alleged that in April 1999, Seyfert enlisted Elk Creek Township Supervisor Harold "Frosty" Crane to help her acquire the equipment, which was slated to be transferred to a volunteer fire department. Individuals are prohibited from acquiring such equipment through this program. Seyfert pleaded guilty to theft of federal property and conspiring to influence a witness on May 12, 2000. In the plea agreement, prosecutors agreed to drop more serious charges that she attempted to have a witness change his testimony. The judge sentenced her to five years in federal prison and assessed a $5,000 fine. Seyfert was released from federal prison on March 20, 2001. Joseph Wenzel, a former legislative aide and close associate of Seyfert, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to tamper with a witness in Seyfert's trial. Wenzel admitted to working with Seyfert to get Harold "Frosty" Crane to lie to the FBI during its investigation. In exchange for his guilty plea, federal prosecutors "agreed not to pursue accusations that Wenzel asked his brother to kill the witness.

He went to Paris and studied with Alfred Jaëll, Louis Plaidy (teacher of Hans von Bülow and many others), Théodore Ritter (another student of Liszt), and Édouard Batiste. In 1869, he became acquainted with Anton Rubinstein, and later studied with him. He travelled with Rubinstein during his first American tour in 1872-73. Ignacy Jan Paderewski changed his execution of octave playing after hearing Sanford play, and once described Sanford as the most musically gifted person he ever knew. Sanford brought Sir Edward Elgar's music to American attention through the brothers Walter and Frank Damrosch and Theodore Thomas. He was instrumental in having Elgar awarded an honorary doctorate in music from Yale University in 1905; at the conferral ceremony on 28 June, Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 was played, instituting the tradition of playing noble processional music at graduation ceremonies. Later that year, Elgar returned the compliment by dedicating his Introduction and Allegro to Sanford. Sanford joined the Yale Music Faculty as Professor of Applied Music in 1894, along with Horatio Parker as Professor of Theory. During the sixteen years he worked at Yale, he refused to be paid any salary as he was independently wealthy. He died at home on 6 January 1910 after a long illness.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giuseppe_Antonio_Brescianello	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bologna	Giuseppe Antonio Brescianello (also Bressonelli; ca. 1690, Bologna – 4 October 1758, Stuttgart) was an Italian Baroque composer and violinist. His name is mentioned for the first time in a document from 1715 in which the Maximilian II Emanuel appointed him violinist in his court orchestra in Munich. Soon after, in 1716, after the death of Johann Christoph Pez, he got the job of music director and as a maître des concerts de la chambre at the Württemberg court in Stuttgart. In 1717, he was appointed Hofkapellmeister. Around 1718, he composed the pastorale opera La Tisbe, which he dedicated to the Archduke Eberhard Ludwig. Brescianello did this in vain hope that his opera would be listed at the Stuttgart theatre. In the years from 1719 to 1721, a fierce conflict emerged, in which Reinhard Keiser repeatedly attempted to get Brescianello's post. In 1731, Brescianello became Oberkapellmeister. In 1737, the court had financial problems which led to the dissolution of the opera staff and Brescianello lost his position. For this reason, he dedicated himself increasingly to composition and this resulted in his 12 concerti e sinphonie op. 1 and some time later the 18 Pieces for gallichone (gallichone here means mandora, a type of lute). In 1744, the financial problems at the court diminished and he was reappointed as Oberkapellmeister by Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg, mostly "because of his special knowledge of music and excellent skills". He led the court and opera music until he was pensioned off in the period between 1751 and 1755. His successors were Ignaz Holzbauer and then Niccolò Jommelli.

The Order, which was approved by Pope Alexander IV in 1261, was the first religious order of knighthood to grant the rank of 'militissa' to women who were the daughter, spouse or widow of a Knight. Its mission was to promote peace between warring municipal factions, but its members soon succumbed to self-interest and it was suppressed by Sixtus V in 1558. In 1267 he joined the Jovial Friars' monastery that he had founded at Ronzano where he stayed until his death. In Dante Alighieri's Inferno (of the Divine Comedy), he is found among the hypocrites in the Eighth Circle of Hell. Loderingo is extolled for his fortitude in dying by his friend the poet Guittone d'Arezzo. He is also known as Loderingo degli Andalò, Loderingo d'Andalò, and Loderigo d'Andalo.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Papa	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bridgeport,_Connecticut	Papa signed with the Orioles in 1958 for a $65,000 bonus. That season, Major League Baseball rescinded the infamous "bonus rule" that would have mandated that the Orioles keep Papa on their 25-man roster for two full seasons; the rule was blamed for wrecking the careers of numerous "bonus babies" whose talents rusted on the bench, rather than being developed in the minors. Sent to the Baltimore farm system, Papa hurt his arm in his third pro season, trying to throw the slider in Class B. But he made the Baltimore opening-season 28-man roster in 1961 at the age of 20. In his big-league debut, on April 11, 1961 — Opening Day for the Orioles, and the first American League game in the history of the Los Angeles Angels franchise — Papa was called into the game in the top of the second inning to relieve an ineffective Milt Pappas. He surrendered a three-run home run to the first batter he faced, Ted Kluszewski — Kluszewski's second homer in two innings. But he struck out the next batter, Bob Cerv, to end the inning. Five days later, he again was called upon to take over for an ineffective starting pitcher: in this case, Chuck Estrada, who failed to record an out in the first inning against the Minnesota Twins. Papa struck out two hitters, Earl Battey and Billy Gardner, but gave up three bases on balls, a single and one earned run before he was relieved by Dick Hall. He then was sent back to the minors, but compiled a frustrating 0–11 season split between Double-A and Triple-A Oriole affiliates. In 1962, Papa appeared in one game, in the Major Leagues, on September 16. In one inning, he gave up three hits, three earned runs and one walk against the Kansas City Athletics. In his three MLB appearances, he gave up five hits and five earned runs in two full innings pitched, walking four and striking out three. His minor career continued through 1965. After getting a degree in business administration, Papa became a businessman and elected municipal official in Shelton, Connecticut.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/José_María_Lamamié_de_Clairac	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salamanca	José María Lamamié de Clairac y de la Colina (16 August 1887 in Salamanca – 27 April 1956 in Salamanca) was a Spanish politician, lawyer, Salamancan landowner, a right-wing Catholic, a Carlist Traditionalist deputy during the Spanish Second Republic. Having been educated by Jesuits in Valladolid he pursued further studies in Salamanca and Madrid. He was one of the founding members of the National Association of Catholic Propagandists (ACNdeP), (1908, in Madrid). This institution was part of the Church's aspiration towards "the fostering of an alternative Christian culture, offering the faithful different political, literary, and social choices from those provided by a liberal state." An uncompromisingly elitist organisation from the beginning, the Association insisted upon remaining 'a very select minority' as befitted its nature as one of 'the institutions called upon to lead'. Though hand picked by the founder Father Angel Ayala SJ however, he left the Propagandists accusing them of betraying the Catholic cause. Clairac espoused the cause of Catholic agrarianism, becoming president of the Salamancan Catholic-Agrarian Federation and the Castilian-Leonese-Catholic-Agrarian Union. He also sat on the CNCA ( National Catholic Agrarian Confederation) directorate from 1921. "The controlling interest of the landowners in the new confederation was clear, if generally denied." Though Clairac was initially an enthusiastic supporter of the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–30), Primo forfeited much conservative and clerical support when in November 1926 he offered the socialist union Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) a leading position in the reorganisation of labour relations. In common with many of those who were to emerge as leading figures on the Catholic right during the Second Republic, Clairac gained considerable political experience under Primo, sitting as a representative for the province of Salamanca in the dictator's National Assembly.As republicanism gained ground Clairac was part of a monarchist counter-offensive in which Catholic activists predominated. The Catholic Church continued to assert its primacy over matters affecting the morality of Christian people. Pius XI's 1929 encyclical Divini illius magistri for instance, on the Christian education of youth, said that the Church 'directly and perpetually' possessed 'the whole truth' in the moral sphere. Education was therefore, 'first and super-eminently' the function of the Church. The Spanish Church perceived its moral rights and duties to be divinely ordained and looked for the protection it felt was its due. (Despite the assurance of Leo XIII decades earlier that Catholicism was compatible with various forms of government, a preference for authoritarian rule remained deep-seated within the Spanish Church.) Clairac introduced his new agrarian grouping Acción Castellana to an audience of 2,500 in the town of Macotera. The flag of Acción Castellana was that of the fatherland and written on it were the principles of 'religion, family, Order, Property and monarchy.' A lifelong supporter of the Carlist pretender, he launched his new party in the political confusion of 1930 to promote agricultural interests and conservative social values and " seemed unperturbed by the paradoxical position of a Carlist defending the Alfonsine incumbent of the throne. His party was dominated by Castilian landlords and displayed the authoritarian preferences so common among the contemporary Catholic right."  Acción Castellana's manifesto began with a declaration that there was no society without authority and that authority not of divine origin was not worthy of respect. Clairac's political grouping believed the idea of a republic was nothing more than an 'exotic implant'. Similarly, the possibility of a conservative republic was rejected - it would simply act as a bridge towards radicalism and atheism. The only true morals were Catholic ones and an absolute submission to the doctrines of the Church was essential in both private and public life. Clairac maintained that the introduction of 'false liberties and democratic absurdities' had been the 'great sin' of Primo de Rivera's dictatorship. Though Clairac did not like the word 'party' to describe his group, Acción Castellana quickly assumed a party political role. Within the Carlist community Clairac, like his brother-in-law and fellow landowner Jaime Chicharro, were marked men for a new breed of radical activists, led by Jaime del Burgo Torres. The group favoured social reform and limitation of wealth to feudal egoism of the odious grandees of grain. Between November 1934 and March 1935, the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) minister for agriculture, Manuel Giménez Fernández, introduced into parliament a series of agrarian reform measures designed to make conditions in the Spanish countryside better. These moderate proposals provoked a bitter attack from reactionary elements within the Cortes - amongst Giménez Fernández's most vehement opponents was José María Lamamié de Clairac. He took particular exception to draft legislation giving tenants of twelve years standing the right to buy the lands they worked. "Clairac persisted in construing even the mildest agrarian reform as an attack on property, maintaining that, despite his good intentions, the efforts of the CEDA minister would have exactly the same results as the Republican reform of 1931-32."  The proposed reform was not only defeated in the Cortes but also ensured a change of personnel in the ministry - "for all the social Catholic rhetoric, the extreme right had won the day." Following the defeat of the CEDA in the elections of February 1936 and the victory of the Popular Front the Traditionalists took this for the CEDA's death knell - Traditionalist deputies severed their connections with both the CEDA and Calvo Sotelo's Bloque Nacional to form an independent grouping under the leadership of José María Lamamié de Clairac.

They were born joined at the back of the skull and faced in opposite directions. In 1997, Dr. Ben Carson led a team of 50 Zambian and South African specialists to separate the 11-month-old twins in a 22-hour operation. They did not share any organs, but shared intricate blood vessels that flowed into each other's brains. In 2001, the twins were fitted with artificial skulls to permanently close their heads, and are neurologically normal. In an interview, Dr. Carson stated about the operation: "In the end, the Bandas became the first Type 2 craniopagus twins (joined at the head and facing in opposite directions) ever separated with both surviving and both being neurologically normal." They are residing in a low-cost/high-density area of Lusaka called Chilenje South.

In 1906 he published the first of his many papers on electron affinity, and, simultaneously with the English chemist Thomas Martin Lowry, he introduced the protonic theory of acid-base reactions in 1923. That same year, Gilbert N. Lewis proposed an electronic theory of acid-base reactions, but both theories remain commonly used. He became known as an authority on catalysis by acids and bases and was the namesake of the Brønsted catalysis equation. Working with Lowry, he also developed the often-used theory of proton donation, theorizing that a hydrogen atom (which is always found in an acid) ionizes into hydronium upon dissolving in water, thereby losing its electron and becoming a proton donor, and that hydroxide (a water molecule stripped of one of its two hydrogen atoms) is a proton receiver. Mixing the two causes a neutralization reaction wherein hydronium and hydroxide combine, creating hydrogen hydroxide, a compound otherwise known as water. The pH scale may be interpreted as "power of hydrogen", and the definition is based on the work of Brønsted and Lowry. In World War II, Brønsted's opposition to the Nazis led to his election to the Danish parliament in 1947, but he was too ill to take his seat and died shortly after the election.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diocletian	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salona	Diocletian (/ˌdaɪ.əˈkliːʃən/; Latin: Gaius Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus Augustus), born Diocles (244–312), was a Roman emperor from 284 to 305. Born to a family of low status in the Roman province of Dalmatia, Diocletian rose through the ranks of the military to become cavalry commander to the Emperor Carus. After the deaths of Carus and his son Numerian on campaign in Persia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. The title was also claimed by Carus' other surviving son, Carinus, but Diocletian defeated him in the Battle of the Margus. Diocletian's reign stabilized the empire and marks the end of the Crisis of the Third Century. He appointed fellow officer Maximian as Augustus, co-emperor, in 286. Diocletian delegated further on 1 March 293, appointing Galerius and Constantius as Caesars, junior co-emperors. Under this 'tetrarchy', or "rule of four", each emperor would rule over a quarter-division of the empire. Diocletian secured the empire's borders and purged it of all threats to his power. He defeated the Sarmatians and Carpi during several campaigns between 285 and 299, the Alamanni in 288, and usurpers in Egypt between 297 and 298. Galerius, aided by Diocletian, campaigned successfully against Sassanid Persia, the empire's traditional enemy. In 299 he sacked their capital, Ctesiphon. Diocletian led the subsequent negotiations and achieved a lasting and favorable peace. Diocletian separated and enlarged the empire's civil and military services and reorganized the empire's provincial divisions, establishing the largest and most bureaucratic government in the history of the empire. He established new administrative centres in Nicomedia, Mediolanum, Antioch, and Trier, closer to the empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome had been. Building on third-century trends towards absolutism, he styled himself an autocrat, elevating himself above the empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's expenditures and necessitated a comprehensive tax reform. From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more equitable, and levied at generally higher rates. Not all of Diocletian's plans were successful: the Edict on Maximum Prices (301), his attempt to curb inflation via price controls, was counterproductive and quickly ignored. Although effective while he ruled, Diocletian's tetrarchic system collapsed after his abdication under the competing dynastic claims of Maxentius and Constantine, sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. The Diocletianic Persecution (303–11), the empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official persecution of Christianity, did not destroy the empire's Christian community; indeed, after 324 Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under its first Christian emperor, Constantine. In spite of these failures and challenges, Diocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government and helped stabilize the empire economically and militarily, enabling the empire to remain essentially intact for another hundred years despite being near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth. Weakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, and became the first Roman emperor to abdicate the position voluntarily. He lived out his retirement in his palace on the Dalmatian coast, tending to his vegetable gardens. His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of Split in Croatia.

He lives in Spain where he has established a government in exile, to the annoyance of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema. Born at Acock in Rio Muni, Moto trained to become a Catholic priest. Under President Francisco Macías Nguema, he was a radio operator and newspaper editor during the 1970s, but he was eventually placed under house arrest and was not released until Obiang overthrew Macias in 1979. Obiang initially entrusted Moto with a series of important jobs: he represented Equatorial Guinea at the Non-Aligned Movement's summit in Havana in September 1979, he was appointed as Technical Director at the Ministry of Information and Tourism in 1980, and he was promoted to the post of Minister of Information and Tourism in 1981. However, Moto and President Obiang had a falling-out shortly thereafter, apparently due to disagreement over policy and Moto's preference for reforms to allow more openness; he fled Equatorial Guinea in December 1981 and settled in Spain, where he remained active as an opposition leader in exile. Returning home as an opposition leader, Moto was imprisoned at Malabo's reviled Black Beach prison, but later released and allowed to go back into exile. He claims to have won several elections in Equatorial Guinea. He was reportedly on good terms with José María Aznar, who was Prime Minister of Spain from 1996 to 2004. Due to this and his position as the main contender to become president after a coup, he was accused by Equatorial Guinea of being the instigator of the March 2004 attempt led by Simon Mann and Nick du Toit, and tried in absentia. He disappeared for a short time in 2005, only to reappear unharmed. He claimed a pair of hitmen had taken him out on a yacht in Dubrovnik, Croatia, only to let him go because he was a fellow Roman Catholic.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giovanni_Baptista_Ferrari	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siena	Giovanni Baptista (also Battista) Ferrari (1584 in Siena – 1 February 1655 in Siena), was an Italian Jesuit and professor in Rome, a botanist, and an author of illustrated botanical books and a Latin-Syrian dictionary. He was born to an affluent Sienese family and entered the Jesuit Order in Rome in 1602. His career, besides the authoring of two important works, included being professor of Hebrew and Rhetoric at the Jesuit College in Rome and horticultural advisor to the Pope. Giovanni Ferrari Baptista was linguistically highly gifted and an able scientist, who, at 21 years of age, knew a good deal of Hebrew and spoke and wrote excellent Greek and Latin. He was editor of a Latin-Syrian dictionary (Nomenclator syriacus, 1622). Ferrari devoted himself till 1632 to the study and cultivation of ornamental plants, and published De Florum Cultura, which was illustrated with copperplates by, amongst others, Anna Maria Variana, possibly the first female copper-engraver. The first book deals with the design and maintenance of the garden and garden equipment. The second book provides descriptions of the different flowers, while the third book deals with the culture of these flowers. The fourth book, continues with a treatise on the use and beauty of the flower species, including their different varieties and mutations. The plants featured in Ferrari's research came from Cardinal Francesco Barberini's private botanical garden, the Horti Barberini, a garden which was under the care of Ferrari. The first edition of his de florum publication was dedicated to Barberini and the second was dedicated to Barberini's sister-in-law, Anna Colonna. Another work is the Hesperides sive de Malorum Aureorum Cultura et Usu Libri Quatuor, first published in 1646. Ferrari's close relationship with Cassiano dal Pozzo (1588-1657), a noted scholar and student of citrus, led to the creation of this work. The first volume of this work is devoted to citrus and its many varieties and variations. The plates were produced by the best artists of the time, such as Johann Friedrich Greuter, Cornelis Bloemaert and Nicolas Joseph Foucault. Plates were also prepared by the renowned painters and draughtsmen of Roman Baroque, such as Pietro da Cortona, Andrea Sacchi, Nicolas Poussin, Pietro Paolo Ubaldini, F. Perier, Francesco Albani, Philippe Gagliard, F. Ramanelli, Guido Reni, Dominic Zampieri and H. Rinaldi. The plates show life-sized whole fruit, including sections. Other plates show Hercules, mythological scenes, garden buildings, Orangeries, garden tools, etc.. Both works are important as they display accurate representations. Ferrari was the first scientist to provide a complete description of the limes, lemons and pomegranates. He also described medical preparations, the details on citron and prescribed limes, lemons and pomegranates as medicinal plants against scurvy.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marco_Lusini	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siena	Marco Lusini (Siena 8 September 1936 - Florence 3 October 1989) was an Italian artist who worked in painting, sculpture, photography, and poetry. Born in Siena, he attended art school before relocating to Florence in 1960. Here, he involved himself in the "Bazzechi" photographic studio before becoming well known as a painter. He actively contributed to the city's cultural life, thereby becoming a friend and collaborator to such writers and poets as Mario Luzi, Alessandro Parronchi, Elvio Natali, Piero Santi, Elio Filippo Accrocca, Enzo Carli, Alfonso Gatto, Giulio Guberti, Franco Solmi, Carlo Segala, and Claudio Spadoni. He achieved fame throughout Italy and internationally. Italian poet Mario Luzi opined that the "intense figurations of extraneousness and undeception" of Lusini's earlier work allowed the viewer to "let us know him". Luzi contrasted this with some of Lusini's later work, which he thought carried with it "a new utmost feeling of expectation and perhaps even something more... the very acute sense of the imminence of a final event". The art critic Elvio Natali noted that the "one unfailing subject" which recurred throughout Lusini's work was "The human image, whether it is a woman's image or a man's image, often asexual, as a symbol of a common, undifferentiated destiny." He nevertheless noted that Lusini's work went through several cycles, among them "Lovers", "Mysterious figures", "Homage to Brecht", "Object Woman", and "Oneiric Landscapes". In 1978, Lusini exhibited his work in Miami, Florida.Following Lusini's death, Gerhard Gruitrooy devoted his paper on Giovanni Battista Naldini to Lusini's memory in volume seventeen of The J. Paul Getty Museum Journal.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pedro_de_Soto	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salamanca	Pedro de Soto (1493-1563) was a Spanish Dominican theologian.

Later, for six years, he served as senior chair of theology at the University of Dillingen, where he disputed with Protestants and worked with the Bishop of Augsburg to establish a Catholic academic stronghold. In May 1555 he was sent to London to take part in the late stages of the persecutions that led to the executions of the Oxford Martyrs, and was more generally involved in Reginald Pole's efforts to solidify England's return to Catholicism under Mary I. He served as theology professor at the University of Oxford from October 1555 to August 1556, teaching a course on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, with the Regius Professorship of Hebrew being temporarily appropriated to give him a position. He was first theologian of Pope Pius IV at the third convocation of the Council of Trent (1559), but was accused in 1560 by the Inquisition in Valladolid of being influenced by Lutheranism, largely on the basis of having urged approval of Bartolomé Carranza's Catechism, and comments he made at the Council. During the Council he wrote scripture-based poems that were set to music by the Flemish composer Jacobus de Kerle which reportedly influenced the deliberations of the Council Fathers on sacred music. He died in Trent in 1563 while the trial was still in its early stages.

He served as the fifth President of Iran from 3 August 1997 to 3 August 2005. He also served as Iran's Minister of Culture from 1982 to 1992. He was an outspoken critic of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government. Little known until that point, Khatami attracted global attention during his first election to the presidency when he captured almost 70% of the vote. Khatami had run on a platform of liberalization and reform. During his two terms as president, Khatami advocated freedom of expression, tolerance and civil society, constructive diplomatic relations with other states including those in Asia and the European Union, and an economic policy that supported a free market and foreign investment. Khatami is known for his proposal of Dialogue Among Civilizations. The United Nations proclaimed the year 2001 as the United Nations' Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations, on Khatami's suggestion. On 8 February 2009, Khatami announced that he would run in the 2009 presidential election. On 16 March, he announced he was withdrawing from the race in favor of his long-time friend and adviser, former Prime Minister of Iran, Mir-Hossein Mousavi. In October 2009, the award committee of the Global Dialogue Prize declared Dariush Shayegan and Mohammad Khatami as joint winners of the inaugural award, "for their work in developing and promoting the concept of a 'dialogue among cultures and civilizations' as new paradigm of cultural subjectivity and as new paradigm of international relations". The Global Dialogue Prize is one of the world's most significant recognitions for research in the Humanities, honoring "excellence in research and research communication on the conditions and content of a global intercultural dialogue on values". In January 2010, Mohammad Khatami stated that "he was not in the position to accept the award", and the prize was given to Dariush Shayegan alone. Currently the Iranian media are forbidden on the orders of Tehran's prosecutor from publishing pictures of Khatami, or quoting his words, on account of his support for the defeated reformist candidates in the disputed 2009 re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mohamed_Oufkir	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bouarfa,_Morocco	Mohamed Oufkir is a native of Ain-Chair, in the Tafilalt region, the stronghold of high Atlas Moroccan Berbers, in the south-eastern Morocco, where his father was appointed pasha by Lyautey in 1910. His great-grandfather was from Sidi Bel Abbes in Algeria northwest. He studied at the berber College of Azrou near Meknes. In 1939, he entered the Military Academy of Dar El Beida, and in 1941, he enlisted as a reserve lieutenant in the French army. During World War II, he served with distinction in the French army (4th Regiment of Moroccan Tirailleurs) in Italy in 1944 where he won the Croix de Guerre. He was also awarded the Silver Star in 1944 by Major General Alfred M. Gruenther, general Clark's chief of staff, after the Battle of Monte Cassino. After the war, he fought with French forces in Vietnam from 1947 to 1949, where his bravery was dubbed "legendary". In 1949 he was promoted captain and named to the Legion d'Honneur. As the right-hand man of King Hassan II in the 1960s and early 1970s, Oufkir led government supervision of politicians, unionists and the religious establishment. He forcefully repressed political protest through police and military clampdowns, pervasive government espionage, show trials, and numerous extralegal measures such as killings and forced disappearances. A feared figure in dissident circles, he was considered extraordinarily close to power. One of his most famous victims is believed to have been celebrated third-world politician Mehdi Ben Barka, who had "disappeared" in Paris in 1965. A French court convicted him of the murder. In 1967, Oufkir was named interior minister, vastly increasing his power through direct control over most of the security establishment. After a failed republican military coup in 1971, he was named chief of staff and minister of defense, and set about purging the army and promoting his personal supporters. His domination of the Moroccan political scene was now near-complete, with the king ever more reliant on him to contain mounting discontent. Oufkir was accused of plotting the 1972 Moroccan coup attempt against King Hassan II. Though official sources claimed that the general had committed suicide in response to the failure of the coup, his daughter, Malika Oufkir, writing in her book Stolen Lives, claims to have seen five bullet wounds in her father's body, all in positions not consistent with suicide. It is generally accepted outside of official circles that Oufkir was executed by forces loyal to the Moroccan monarchy. On orders of the king, Oufkir's entire family was then sent to secret desert prison camps. They were not released until 1991, after American and European pressure on the government. After five years under close police supervision, they fled to France. This story is detailed by Oufkir's daughter Malika in the book Stolen Lives: Twenty Years in a Desert Jail. His wife Fatima and his son Raouf also published their accounts of the period.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Humphrey_Cobb	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siena	Cobb was born in Siena, Italy. He served with the Canadian Army for three years during the First World War and fought in the Battle of Amiens. Stephen E. Tabachnick, in the Afterword to the U of Georgia Press' 1987 reprint of Paths of Glory supplies additional details of Cobb's life and how the son of American parents, Arthur Cobb, an artist, and his wife Alice Littell Cobb, a physician, came to be mistakenly identified as a Canadian author. It had much to do with Cobb's many years as an expatriate living in foreign locations, and his decision to take part in World War I in 1916, well before the United States entry into the war, by joining the Canadian Army. Cobb's parents sent him to school in England for his primary education and only at age 13 did he come to the United States to continue his schooling. After being expelled from high school at age 17, he traveled to Montreal to enlist in a Canadian regiment. Following the war, Cobb worked in the stock trade, the merchant marine, publishing, advertising, and the Office of War Information (the US spy agency before OSS & CIA) writing overseas propaganda. He wrote Paths of Glory, while employed by George Gallup at New York's Young & Rubicam advertising agency. Cobb wrote a second less well received novel, None But the Brave, which was serialized in Collier's Weekly in 1938. From 1935 to 1940 he was employed as a screenwriter. At the time of his death, Cobb was working as an advertising copywriter for the New York firm of Kenyon & Eckhardt. Another American writer named Cobb, the unrelated Irvin S. Cobb, also wrote a World War I book called Paths of Glory (1915), a non-fiction account of his journalistic experiences during the war. "Paths of Glory" is also the title of at least three non-World War I books, by Anthony Clayton (2007), Stephen Brumwell (2008), and Jeffrey Archer (2009), and with variations the phrase has appeared in the longer titles of more than a dozen books.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Baum	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hagerstown,_Maryland	Martin Baum (15 June 1765 in Hagerstown, Maryland – 14 December 1831 in Cincinnati, Ohio ) was an American businessman and politician. The son of German immigrants Jacob Baum and Magdalena Elizabeth Kershner, Baum fought with General Anthony Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. After settling in Cincinnati, Baum became active in civic affairs, and was elected mayor in 1807 and 1812. Through his agents in Baltimore, New Orleans and Philadelphia, Baum attracted a great number of German immigrants to work in his various enterprises — steamboats, a sugar refinery, a foundry, and real estate. Baum founded the Western Museum, was active in the first public library in 1802, and was one of the main pillars of the First Presbyterian Church. He married Anna Somerville Wallace in 1804. He bought the 9-acre (36,000 m2) property on Pike Street in 1812, to build his home. Baum completed construction in about 1820; the building, once lived in by Nicholas Longworth (the first) and David Sinton, is now the Taft Museum. The building is the best example of the Federal style in Cincinnati. Baum was caught in the financial upheaval of 1819-20, and he was eventually forced to deed his home back to the Bank of the United States in 1825. Baum died during an influenza epidemic. He was buried in the First Presbyterian Ground. On 6 June 1853 his body was moved to Spring Grove Cemetery. One of the cars of the Mount Adams Incline was named in his honor.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lautaro	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treguaco	Lautaro (Mapudungun: Lef-Traru "swift hawk") (1534? – April 29, 1557) was a young Mapuche toqui who achieved notoriety for leading the indigenous resistance against Spanish conquest in Chile. Lautaro begun his career as a captive of Pedro de Valdivia but escaped in 1551. Back among his people he was declared toqui and led Mapuche warriors into a series of victories against the Spanish culminating in the Battle of Tucapel in December 1553 where Pedro de Valdivia was killed. The outbreak of a typhus plague, a drought and a famine prevented the Mapuches from taking further actions to expel the Spanish in 1554 and 1555. Between 1556 and 1557 a small group of Mapuches commanded by Lautaro attempted to reach Santiago to liberate the whole of Central Chile from Spanish rule. Lautaros attempts ended in 1557 when he was killed in an ambush by the Spanish. Today Lautaro is revered among Mapuches and non-Mapuche Chileans for his resistance against foreign conquest, servitude and cruelty.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Shelby	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hagerstown,_Maryland	Isaac Shelby (December 11, 1750 – July 18, 1826) was the first and fifth Governor of Kentucky and served in the state legislatures of Virginia and North Carolina. He was also a soldier in Lord Dunmore's War, the Revolutionary War, and the War of 1812. While governor, he led the Kentucky militia in the Battle of the Thames, an action that was rewarded with a Congressional Gold Medal. Counties in nine states, and several cities and military bases, have been named in his honor. His fondness for John Dickinson's The Liberty Song is believed to be the reason Kentucky adopted the state motto "United we stand, divided we fall". Shelby's military service began when he served as second-in-command to his father at the Battle of Point Pleasant, the only major battle of Lord Dunmore's War. He gained the reputation of an expert woodsman and surveyor, and spent the early part of the Revolutionary War gathering supplies for the Continental Army. Later in the war, he and John Sevier led expeditions over the Appalachian Mountains against the British forces in North Carolina. He played a pivotal role in the British defeat at the Battle of King's Mountain. For his service, he was presented with a ceremonial sword and a pair of pistols by the North Carolina legislature, and the nickname "Old King's Mountain" followed him the rest of his life. Following the war, Shelby relocated to Kentucky on lands awarded to him for his military service and became involved in Kentucky's transition from a county of Virginia to an independent state. His heroism made him popular with the state's citizens, and the state electoral college unanimously elected him governor in 1792. He secured the state from Indian attacks and organized its first government. He used the Citizen Genet affair to convince the Washington administration to make an agreement with the Spanish for free trade on the Mississippi River. At the end of his gubernatorial term, Shelby retired from public life, but he was called back into politics by the impending War of 1812. Kentuckians urged Shelby to run for governor again and lead them through the anticipated conflict. He was elected easily, and at the request of General William Henry Harrison, commanded troops from Kentucky at the Battle of the Thames. After the war, he declined President James Monroe's offer to become Secretary of War. In his last act of public service, he and Andrew Jackson acted as commissioners to negotiate the Jackson Purchase from the Chickasaw Indian tribe. Shelby died at his estate in Lincoln County, Kentucky, on July 18, 1826.

He is considered one of the two outstanding Dominican scholars of his generation. He had as a master Lancelotto Politi, some of whose writings he later publicly criticised. Sixtus coined the term deuterocanonical to describe certain books of the Old Testament that had not been accepted as canonical but which appeared in the Septuagint, and the definer for the Roman Catholics of the terms protocanonical and the ancient term apocryphal. His work Bibliotheca sancta ex præcipuis Catholicæ Ecclesiæ auctoribus collecta (Venice 1566) treats the sacred writers and their works, the best manner of translating and explaining Holy Writ, and gives a copious list of Biblical interpreters, in eight books. It was the first of the genre of encyclopedic teaching repertories of dogma and Church tradition issued in the wake of the Council of Trent.

Francisco de Montejo y Alvarez Francisco de Montejo was born in Salamanca, Spain, in 1479 to Juan de Montejo and Catalina Álvarez de Tejeda. He left Spain in 1514, and arrived in Cuba in time to join Grijalva's expedition along the coast of Yucatán and the Gulf of Mexico. There he had the rank of Captain, and command of 4 ships. On his return to Cuba, he joined the Hernán Cortés expedition, and helped found the city of Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz with Alonso Hernandez Puertocarrero. Cortés sent Francisco and Alonso as proctors to King Charles of Spain in 1519 to report on the expedition. While in Spain Montejo married Beatriz de Herrera. In December 1526 the Spanish King, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, issued a royal decree naming Montejo Adelantado and Capitan General of Yucatán. He returned to Yucatán in 1528, and attempted to conquer it along the east coast (Tulum, Chetumal) but was driven back by the ferocity of the resistance of the Maya living along this coast. In 1530 he decided to try conquering Yucatán from the west, and began by pacifying what is today the modern Mexican state of Tabasco. From 1531–1535 he tried unsuccessfully to conquer western Yucatán, with some successes but in 1535 his forces were driven from Yucatán. In 1533, Montejo received a royal decree giving him permission to conquer Puerto Caballos and Naco in Honduras. This put him in conflict with Pedro de Alvarado, who had received a similar decree in 1532. This only became an issue after Alvarado declared he had conquered and pacified the province of Honduras in 1536. Alvarado continued as Governor of Honduras until 1540, although he was recalled to Spain in 1537. In 1540, the Spanish King awarded the Governorship of Honduras to Montejo, and he traveled to Gracias a Dios to install an administration loyal to him. It would fall to Montejo's son, Francisco de Montejo ("el Mozo") (born 1502, died 1565), to conquer Yucatán. He founded the city of San Francisco de Campeche in 1540, and Mérida in 1542. In 1546, the elder Montejo assumed the title of Governor and Captain General of Yucatán. However, by 1550 complaints about him caused him to be recalled to Spain where he died in 1553. Montejo was survived by his eponymous son, and a daughter, Catalina Montejo y Herrera.

He was a graduate student of Enrico Fermi at the University of Rome, receiving his doctorate in 1938.Remaining in Italy during World War II, he did fundamental research under difficult conditions in the basement of a high school, which first clarified the nature of the muon. In 1946 he emigrated to the United States, where he worked first at MIT with Bruno Rossi, and then at BNL's Cosmotron, developing faster nuclear electronics and essential techniques for extracting, transporting, and focusing beams of high energy particles. Later at UC Berkeley's Lawrence Radiation laboratory he was a co-discoverer of the antineutron in 1955 at the Bevatron. His important contributions to the design of the experiment that discovered the antiproton in 1955 were acknowledged in the 1959 ceremony in which the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to E. Segrè and O. Chamberlain.Unfortunately a famous quarrel over credit and priority for the discovery embittered Piccioni for much of his later life, to the point that he filed a lawsuit in 1972 against Segrè and Chamberlain, seeking damages and public acknowledgment of his contributions. The suit was ultimately dismissed as filed too late for consideration of the issues. An important theoretical paperwith Abraham Pais in 1955 considered regeneration in neutral kaon mixing. In 1960 he joined the faculty of the University of California at San Diego (UCSD), where his group made the first measurement of the neutral kaon K1-K2 mass difference. Piccioni retired from UCSD as Professor Emeritus in 1986, but continued to give review talks and work in the investigation of fundamental problems in quantum mechanics. In 1999 he was awarded the Mattuecci Medal by the Accademia Nazionale delle Scienze (National Academy of Sciences) in Italy.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ferdinand_Augustijn_Snellaert	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kortrijk	Ferdinand Augustijn Snellaert (21 July 1809 in Kortrijk – 3 July 1872 in Ghent) was a Flemish writer. He studied medicine at the University of Utrecht (1827–1829) and became officer of health in the Dutch army (1830–1835). After his dismissal, he graduated in medicine at the University of Ghent (1836–1837), and became a general practitioner in Ghent. Ferdinand Augustijn Snellaert became active in the Flemish movement. He founded the Maetschappy van Vlaemsche Letteroefening De Tael is gantsch het Volk, and he participated in several Flemish actions, such as the Vlaams petitionnement (1840), the Kunst- en Letterblad (1840), the Dutch Linguistic and Literary Conferences(vanaf 1849), the Rapport van de Grievencommissie (1856–1859) en the Vlaemsch Verbond (1861). In 1847, he succeeded his friend Jan Frans Willems as member of the Royal Belgian Academy in Brussels, where he represented the Flemish cause, and he was one of the co-founders of the Willemsfonds. In 1849, at the first Dutch Linguistic and Literary Conference, he held the opening speech, where he argued every possible means should be used to strengthen the spirit of the people, and that we should fight those who worked against the development of the spirit of the people. Language was believed to be an important tool to influence the character of the people. In the first half of the 1850s Snellaert tried to win a seat on the city council with the support of the moderate Société l'Union and the progressives of the newspaper Broedermin. However, due to the electoral victory of Judocus Delehaye he chose to join the Liberale Associatie ('Liberal Association'), where he was for a brief period a key figure of the pro-Flemish group. However, he failed to break through. His followers, including Jacob Heremans and especially Julius Vuylsteke turned away from him when it became clear that Snellaert, disappointed by the attitude of the Liberale Associatie, started to think again of establishing an ideologically neutral Flemish party. Despite mediation by Adolphe Pierre Sunaert, Snellaert broke in October 1860 with the Liberale Associatie, which led to a rift between the Ghent liberals and the liberal, pro-Flemish Snellaert. A similar conflict arose in 1861 in the Vlaemsch Verbond ("Flemish Union') of which Snellaert was a co-founder. The liberal group made it impossible to maintain this politically neutral Flemish association and would establish in 1866 the Vlaamsche Liberale Vereeniging ('Flemish Liberal Association').

He was elected to the Rajya Sabha in March 2012 from Bihar state. Pradhan was a member of the 14th Lok Sabha of India. He represented the Deogarh constituency of Orissa. Shri Dharmendra Pradhan was also a member of 12th Assembly of Odisha (2000 - 2004) elected from Pallalhara constituency. He is a member of BJP and RSS. He is the son of former BJP MP Dr. Debendra Pradhan. Educational Qualification : M.A.(Anthropology) ,Utkal University Bhubaneswar Pradhan is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) political party. In addition to being a General Secretary, he was assigned additional responsibility to look after the party activities in Jharkhand in August 2011. India's first pilot programme to run two wheelers on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) has been launched by the Union Government in New Delhi to curb air pollution in cities. The pilot project was launched by Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar and is being implemented by Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL) and one of its parent companies, GAIL (India) Limited. ACHIEVEMENTS: 1.   *  Diesel price deregulation a major reform; brings relief to consumers The Government deregulated diesel prices on 18 October 2014. This move coupled with decreasing global crude oil and petroleum product prices has benefitted consumers indirectly as cost of transportation of goods by road has come down. The price of diesel has come down byRs. 11.77 per litre from its highest point of Rs. 58.97 per litre in August 2014 (in Delhi). This price reduction has directly benefitted the poor and the farmers. Deregulation of diesel will eliminate the subsidy burden on this account, besides resulting in better service delivery due to increased competition. The saving in subsidy is available inter-alia, for funding anti-poverty and social sector scheme. 1.   *  PAHAL nationwide direct transfer of cash subsidy on LPG The Government launched a scheme for direct transfer of LPG subsidy to consumers all over the country from January 1, 2015. This is the largest direct cash transfer scheme in the world. Under this scheme, LPG is being sold to consumers at the market rate while the subsidy is directly credited to their bank accounts as per entitlement. As on 19 April 2015, 12.61 crore LPG consumers have joined the scheme and an amount of Rs. 10833 crore has been transferred into the bank accounts of LPG consumers in 34.58 lakh transactions. The scheme will reduce subsidy outgo primarily on account of the diversion subsidized LPG cylinders to the commercial and industrial sectors. The subsidy so saved can be used for also funding Government's priority schemes. 1.   *  Reforms in Hydro-Carbon Sector After the formation of NDA Government, the Hydrocarbon Sector has seen major reforms. They have also found a mention in the speeches of the Prime Minister. A number of these reforms are aimed at extending benefits of Government schemes to the poorer sections of the society. Further, these reforms have also resulted in huge savings on account of subsidy, which is reflected in the budgetary allocation given below: 1.   *  Government strikes fine balance with revised formula for pricing of domestic gas Within five months of taking charge, the National Democratic Alliance government took the bold decision by revising gas prices and put to rest all speculation and doubts regarding this long pending issue. While doing so, a fine balance was stuck between incentivising production and protecting the interests of the consuming sector. The increase in gas prices on the basis of the present formula is 75 percent less than the original formula arrived at by the previous government. This increase in gas price, while incentivizing exploration and production of gas in the country, significantly reduces the increase in the prices of piped and compressed natural gas, cost of production in gas based power plants and urea subsidy (about Rs. 12,000 crore at the time of approval of new gas price formula). A higher outgo on urea subsidy if the old formula was implemented may have resulted in a cut-back in the budgetary allocation to priority sector schemes. 1.   *  "Give It Up": A movement has been launched by the Prime Minister, appealing to wealthier LPG consumers to give up LPG subsidy. As of 18 April 2015, 3.47 lakh consumers have already given up their LPG subsidy, thereby enabling new LPG connections to be provided to the poor. 1.   *  Priority to city gas distribution in gas allocation As an environment friendly measure, highest priority in allocation of natural gas has been given to the transport (CNG) and domestic households (PNG). During August 2014, Government decided to meet 100% demand of CNG and PNG sector through supply of domestic gas. Further, GAIL has been authorized to supply 10% over and above the allocation to meet any fluctuation in demand. As on 31 March 2015, 28.69 lakhs households and 22.60 lakhs vehicles are benefitting from these clean and convenient fuels. 1.   *  Government plans to expand Piped Natural Gas (PNG) Network in Mission Mode The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas aims to expand the PNG network across the country, raising the number of households connected with PNG to one crore within five years. 1.   *  Plans afoot to complete national gas grid At present, 15,000 km. of Gas Pipeline network exists in the country. It is proposed to build another 15,000 km. of additional gas pipeline to complete the national grid. Out of the proposed 15,000 km. gas pipeline, 11,900 km. is already authorized and is at various stages of implementation. In order to expedite the work, 2500 km of pipelines are being planned on the PPP mode. 1.   *  Facilitating supply of natural gas to fertilizer and power sector The Government has approved the MoPNG proposal to supply pooled Natural Gas at uniform delivered price to all grid connected gas based fertilizer plants for urea production. It has also approved the scheme for utilization of stranded gas-based power generation capacity which was a joint proposal from MoPNG and Ministry of Power and will help in revival of 16000 MW stranded gas based power plants. 1.   *  Government reaches out to poor; extends subsidy to 5 kg cylinder In a key step aimed at benefitting the common man, Public Sector OMCs have launched the sale of 5 kg LPG cylinders under free trade LPG scheme in 129 cities. Under the scheme, people can buy a 5 kg LPG cylinder at market price on a "Cash and Carry" basis. This scheme is in addition to 5 kg LPG cylinder regular connections available for people at subsidized rates. 1.   *  Increased availability of LPG to the poor and marginalised sections In order to help poor families get LPG connections, security deposit of LPG cylinder and pressure regulator is borne by Public Sector OMCs from the CSR fund. More than 19 lakh poor families have already benefitted from this scheme, utilising CSR funds of around Rs. 300 cr. 1.   *  12. A consumer empowering portal A new web-based application at www.mylpg.innow provides Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) consumers an integrated solution for all services related to supply of cooking gas and tracking their LPG cylinders from the comfort of their home. This application is available in 13 languages and is a part of the Digital India campaign. 1.   *  13. Ethanol blending in petrol gets impetus to help reduce emission To reduce pollution on account of auto emissions, the Government has given the much needed boost to the programme to blend 5 percent ethanol with petrol by deciding, in December 2014, to procure ethanol at a fixed delivered price ranging between Rs.48.50 to Rs.49.50 per litre (including all taxes and transportation cost). Besides this, the Government has also allowed procurement of ethanol produced from non-food feedstocks, other than molasses. 1.   *  Biodiesel The Government decided on 16.01.2015 to allow the direct sale of Bio-diesel (B100) by private manufacturers, their authorized dealers and Joint Ventures (JVs) of Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) authorized by MoPNG to all consumers. 1.   *  Expansion of fuel retailing network across the country The retail network of Public Sector OMCs is being expanded to facilitate availability of products all over the country, including the rural areas. Under this plan, OMCs have advertised the setting up of new retail outlets at 35668 locations and new regular and Rajiv Gandhi Gramin LPG Vitaran (RGGLV) LPG distributorships at over 7000 locations. 1.   *  16. Auto fuel policy Phase wise implementation of BS IV all over the country by 01.04.2017 was notified. BS IV fuel has been made available all over Northern India from 01-04-2015. MoPNG is ready to supply BS-VI fuel by 2020–21. 1.   *  17. Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve The Government has taken up the construction of three crude oil reserves of 5.33 MMT at Visakhapatnam (1.33 MMT), Mangalore (1.50 MMT) &Padur (2.50 MMT) as a buffer to deal with any disruption in the supply chain. The Vishakhapatnam rock cavern storage facility is ready to receive crude oil. 1.   *  Reforms in production sharing contracts to push investment in exploration In a bid to increase domestic production of oil and gas, the Government has ironed out a number of rigidities in production sharing contracts to instill confidence among investors and ensure that work, which was stuck in a number of blocks, takes off in right earnest and without further delay. Management Committee meetings of more than 100 blocks have been held and work programme of Rs. 9600 crore approved. 1.   *  19. Early Monetisation of Discovered Hydrocarbon Resources Under the policy for early monetization, 34 cases involving hydro-carbon resources worth Rs. 30,000 crore have been resolved. 1.   *  LNG Re-gasification capacity to be enhanced to 32.5 MMTPA The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas will facilitate the increase in capacity for R-LNG to 32.5 Million Metric Tonnes Per Annum (MMTPA) from the current level of 22 MMTPA. 1.   *  Reassessment of hydrocarbon potential to bolster oil and gas production The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has rolled out an elaborate project to reassess hydrocarbon resources in India's sedimentary basins. This project is likely to be completed by March, 2016 and will provide quality data to investors on the prospectivity of the basins. 1.   *  22. Project approved for survey of unappraised sedimentary basins of India This is another crucial step towards increasing India's hydrocarbon production. While reassessing oil and gas potential is one part of the overall effort, the ministry has also approved a project to appraise about 1.5 Million Sq. km in 24 sedimentary basins where no or only scanty geo-scientific data is available. Clearance of six projects under multi-client speculative survey from MoD/MHA has already been obtained. Under this project, 71,855 line km of 2D seismic data is proposed to be acquired at a cost of around Rs. 6800 crore. 1.   *  Oil Ministry gives mega push to complete pending projects The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is making concerted efforts to arrest the decline in production of hydrocarbons from old and mature fields, push for new discoveries to boost India's production and commission projects under implementation. As a result of intensive review and monitoring, 33 major projects worth Rs. 93,244 crore including three joint venture projects,were completed during 2014–15. 1.   *  Government pushes inclusive agenda; reserves 27% of new retail outlets for OBCs As part of the government's agenda to benefit the backward sections of the society, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has, for the first time, implemented reservation of 27% of new Retail Outlets for citizens falling under Other Backward Castes category. This is in addition to 22.5% reservation for Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes. As per current status, against 8208 locations advertised for OBC category response has been received for 2538 locations. 1.   *  25. Oil Ministry contributes to "Swachh Bharat Mission" The Ministry has unveiled a series of initiatives under the "Swachh Bharat Mission". The Ministry aims at developing specific projects to give concrete shape to the initiatives under this Mission. As part of this drive, oil sector PSUs have taken up construction of over 20,000 school toilets. PSUs have also conducted around 6,600 activities including cleanliness drives, awareness campaigns, competitions, plays etc. till 31 March 2015. 1.   *  Oil Ministry chalks out plan to give "Make in India" big push Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's clarion call to make India a manufacturing hub, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has set in motion the process to identify equipment and products in the oil sector, such as LNG ships, that can be manufactured in India. IOC R&D has successfully developed INDMAX (lndane Maximization) technology. Each of the PSUs under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has constituted a specialized Indigenization Development Group (INDEG) to promote indigenization. 1.   *  Skill Development Mission           With the participation of all the major companies in the oil industry, the Hydrocarbon Sector Skill Council (HSSC) has identified 134 roles (QPs) pertaining to the Upstream, Midstream and Gas, Downstream as well as Construction and Services sub-sectors. The HSSC roadmap for Skill Development provides for 19.27 lakh persons to be trained and certified by empanelling 500 institutions and training 1250 trainers. 1.   *  Initiatives in the North-East Oil sector PSUs are currently implementing nine major projects at an estimated cost of Rs.2763 crore for upgradation of existing infrastructure in the North-Eastern region of the country. On 1 December 2014, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi dedicated the Unit II of OTPC Power Plant at Palatana, Tripura to the Nation. A vision group has been constituted to prepare hydrocarbon vision for the North East covering upstream, midstream and downstream sector. For incentivizing exploration and production in the North East region, 40 percent subsidy on gas operations has been extended to the private companies operating in the region. This will boost the exploration activities, increase gas production and enhance the level of economic activities in the region. 1.   *  29. Oil Ministry steps up global engagement Given that India imports nearly 77 percent of its crude oil requirement, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas under Shri Dharmendra Pradhan has carried out a series of engagements with oil and gas producing nations to secure India's interests. 1.   *  Measures to achieve fuel efficiency Standards & Labelling programme is a key initiative undertaken by Ministry through Petroleum Conservation Research Association (PCRA). Under this programme, fuel efficient equipment meeting stipulated standards are awarded Star Rating (1 to 5) by Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE). 1.   *  31. Oil sector introduces student scholarship to generate interest in areas of energy efficiency Scholarships have been introduced by PCRA to ignite and nurture interest in energy efficiency and fuel conservation among meritorious students, who are selected through National-level Quiz, Debate, Essay and Painting competitions. 1.   *  32. Retail outlets opting for solar energy to power operations Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd are progressively using solar energy for lighting their retail outlets. So far, 2140 of their retail outlets have been powered by solar energy resulting in estimated savings of Rs. 1.92 crore. The target is to increase the number to 7200 retail outlets by 31 March 2017. 1.   *  Hydrocarbon sector reforms on the anvil The Ministry has made significant progress in formulating : (a) The model for next round of bidding, (b) Model for outsourcing of marginal fields, (c) Extension of existing production sharing contracts, (d) Testing requirement for discoveries, and (e) Premium on gas produced in High Pressure-High Temperature fields and from Deep and Ultra-Deep water fields.

The novel sparked wild enthusiasm among the Soviet population. Official reaction soon turned against the book, and Dudintsev suffered years of poverty, and was only able to publish occasional works. As the USSR tottered, in 1987, Dudintsev published a novel, The White Robes, for which he was awarded a State Prize the following year. He died in 1998.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sisowath_of_Cambodia	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Battambang	Sisowath (Khmer: ព្រះបាទស៊ីសុវតិ្ថ; 7 September 1840 – 9 August 1927) was king of Cambodia from 1904 to his death in 1927. He was the son of King Ang Duong and half brother of Prince Si Votha and King Norodom. Sisowath was given the birth name of "Ang Sar". When he was born, Cambodia was under joint Siamese and Vietnamese rule. The royal family lived in the Siamese zone rather than live under Vietnam. Like his brother King Norodom, Sisowath was educated in the Siamese capital of Bangkok. He did not return to his native Cambodia until 1860, when his father and the ruling monarch, Ang Duong, died. He hastily returned to Oudong, the royal capital of Cambodia, to prevent his half-brother, Prince Si Votha from seizing the throne. He succeeded, and his other half-brother, Norodom, became king. Although Norodom was more compliant, rebellion broke out in Cambodia, and soon the French, seeking control of Southeast Asia, forced Norodom to comply with a French protectorate over Cambodia. The French thus drove out the Thai and the Vietnamese, and Cambodia became a French protectorate, though it was quite autonomous. Sisowath was enraged - and he exiled himself to Saigon in Vietnam in 1864, the other former overlord of Cambodia, in a show of defiance. The French, who also had control of Saigon, persuaded Sisowath to remain there under French "protection", as his life was in danger by the "rebels in Cambodia". In reality, the French used Sisowath as a tool to threaten Norodom. If Norodom was not following France's policies of reform, they could threaten Norodom with Sisowath and say that they would depose Norodom and replace him with Sisowath if he did not comply. In 1867, when Cambodia was in open rebellion against French rule, King Norodom pleaded Sisowath to return to Cambodia to quell the rising. Sisowath returned from Vietnam to Oudong and helped quell the uprising. In 1884, when the French took full control over Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and also defeated Siam in a war in 1893, Cambodia became an open French colony, and the capital was moved from Oudong to Phnom Penh. Moving with the royal court to Phnom Penh, Sisowath gave his full support to the French colonial regime. Norodom thus was compelled to name Sisowath his future successor. In 1904, when Norodom died, Sisowath was crowned as king of Cambodia, a crown that would have gone to one of Norodom's son, Prince Yukanthor, if the latter didn't have a fall-out with the French. During his reign, Sisowath continued Norodom's role in government, where he was well rewarded by the French for his cooperation: they built him a new palace, gave him a steam-powered yacht, and supplied him with a complementary ration of 250 lbs of high-grade opium per year. In 1927, he died in Phnom Penh and took the posthumous name of Preah Karuna Preah Sisowath Preah Reacheanukot. He was succeeded by his son and crown prince, Prince Sisowath Monivong.

Devaneyan, Ñanamuttan Tevaneyan; lived 1902–1981) was a prominent Indian Tamil author who wrote over 35 books. Additionally, he was a staunch proponent of the "Pure Tamil movement" and initiated the Etymological Dictionary Project primarily to bring out the roots of Tamil words and their connections and ramifications. In his 1966 Primary Classical language of the World, he argues that the Tamil language is the "most natural" (iyal-moḻi) and also a proto-world language, being the oldest (tol-moḻi) language of the world, from which all other major languages of the world are derived. He believed that its literature, later called Sangam literature and usually considered to have been written from 200 BCE and 300 CE, spanned a huge period from 10,000 to 5,500 BCE. These datings gain popularity by journalists such as in Graham Hancock's book Underworld: The Mysterious Origins of Civilization. His above ideas are fringe ones and mainstream linguists, geologists and historians do not acknowledge them to be true. Devaneya Pavanar composed many musical pieces (Isaik kalambakam) and many noteworthy poems, including the collection of Venpa. The title Senthamiḻ Selvar was conferred on him by the Tamil Nadu State Government in 1979, and he was also addressed as Moḻi Ñayiru (மொழி ஞாயிறு) "Sun of language".

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baldomero_Lillo	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lota,_Chile	Baldomero Lillo (1867–1923) was a Chilean Naturalist author, whose works had social protest as their main theme. Lillo's father traveled to California to participate in the 1848 Gold Rush, but returned with no fortune. He did learn much about mining, and he moved to southern Chile, Lota, to work the coal mines. Baldomero Lillo grew up in these mining communities and worked the mines himself. He was exposed to the writings of the French author Émile Zola, who used the philosophy of Positivism and the literary current of Naturalism to try to change the terrible conditions of French coal miners. Lillo was able to observe similar conditions in the Chilean mines and set out to improve the conditions of the workers by dramatizing their plight. Lillo wrote many short stories (collected in two major books, Sub Sole and Sub Terra) which sparked the interest of social activists who were appalled by the conditions in the mines. The story that follows is typical of his efforts. File:Mining.DS50.jpeg In "The Devil's Tunnel" the miners are seemingly trapped by their destiny to live out their squalid and exploited lives, which are dominated by the need for raw materials and the machinery of the Europeans. At the story's end there is a strong contrast between the clean, pure and benevolent sky, and the underground monster that devours the humans who dare to penetrate its dark lair.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Shima	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kurume,_Fukuoka	George Shima (1864–1926) was a Japanese American businessman in California who became the first Japanese American millionaire. At one point, he produced about 85% of the state's potato crop, which earned him the nickname "The Potato King". Born Ushijima Kinji (牛島謹爾) in Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan, he entered a preliminary course at the Tokyo Commercial School (now Hitotsubashi University), but failed the entrance examination for the regular course. He emigrated to San Francisco in 1889 determined to learn English, the subject that gave him the most trouble on the exam. Upon his arrival, he changed his name to George Shima. He first worked as a domestic servant in San Francisco, then became a migrant farm laborer in the Sacramento Delta for a while. Soon afterward, turned his eye to management, when he began supplying Japanese farm workers to white farmers. By the late 1890s, he leased some land and began his own farming operations. He was successful enough to purchase some inexpensive swampland (considered undesirable by white American farmers) in the San Joaquin Delta. After draining and diking the land, he found that potatoes grew best in that type of soil, and using corporate management techniques and the latest agricultural technology, began to corner the market in potatoes. By 1913, he had 28,000 acres (113 km2) in production and by 1920, he had 85% of the market share with his "Shima Fancy" brand, valued at more than $18 million ($212,621,262 today). His business success did not bring him respite from racism, however. In 1909, while trying to purchase a home in Berkeley, he was actively opposed by real estate agents and other homeowners. Despite being the subject of such newspaper headlines as "Yellow Peril in College Town", Shima became active in the community, donating $500 to the local YMCA, and gradually won over his neighbors. Still, the opposition he encountered led him that same year to become the first president of the Japanese Association of America and to unsuccessfully fight the passing of the California Alien Land Law of 1913, which was written to prevent Asians from owning land. In 1926, while on a business trip to Los Angeles, he suffered a stroke and died. That same day he was awarded the Fourth Rank Order of the Rising Sun from the Emperor of Japan. He received the award from Hirohito, later known as Emperor Shōwa. At his funeral, David Starr Jordan, the president of Stanford University, and James Rolph, the Mayor of San Francisco, both served as pallbearers. The Shima Center at San Joaquin Delta College honors his legacy. Yoshinobu Hirotsu, a fellow resident of Shima's hometown of Kurume, also raised several hundred thousand yen to set up a life-sized monument to him in a park there in 1999.

The first director of Shakai Kagaku Kenkyūjo (Institute of Social Science or Shaken) at the University of Tokyo, he studied at Toynbee Hall and School of Economics and Political Science (London School of Economics). Born in Ehime Prefecture, Yanaihara became a Christian under the influence of Uchimura Kanzō's Mukyokai or Nonchurch Movement, while he was studying at the University of Tokyo. In the 1930s he was appointed to the chair of colonial studies at the University of Tokyo, formerly held by his teacher Nitobe Inazō. However, Yanaihara's pacifist views and emphasis on indigenous self-determination, which he partly inherited from Nitobe – a Quaker and founding member of the League of Nations – came into a full conflict with Japan's wartime government during the World War II. He was noted for his criticism of Japan's expansionist policies. As a result, Yanaihara was forced to resign from teaching under pressure by right-wing scholars in 1937. Yanaihara resumed his teaching after the war and taught international economics at the University of Tokyo. He served as the president of the University from 1951 to 1957.

He was the first to develop the technique of iso-area folding, which allows the folder to end up with each side of the paper displayed in equal amounts. It consists of building a mirror-symmetrical crease pattern and then collapsing it to find a finished form, usually a geometric shape such as a cube. He also discovered and proved that with any given flat point in an origami model, the sum of alternating angles is always equal to 180 degrees, a result now known as Kawasaki's theorem.

He was one of the prominent leaders of the sōsaku hanga movement in 20th Century Japan. Hiratsuka was the best–trained woodcarver in the sōsaku hanga movement. From 1928 onwards, he taught the renowned sōsaku hanga artist Shikō Munakata (1903–1975) wood carving. Between 1935 and 1944 Hiratsuka taught the first blockprinting course at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts. He moved to Washington D.C. in 1962, and spent thirty three years in the United States. While living in Washington DC, he was commissioned by three standing Presidents to carve woodblock prints of National Landmarks, which included The Lincoln Memorial, The Washington Monument and The Library of Congress which are in the collections of The National Gallery and Freer Gallery today. He ultimately returned to Japan in 1994. Hiratsuka was awarded the Order of Cultural Merit by the Japanese government in 1970. In 1991, the Hiratsuka Unichi Print Museum was opened in Suzaka, Nagano. Hiratsuka's father was a shrine carpenter, and his grandfather was an architect who designed houses and temples. Therefore, the artist was introduced to wood-working and architecture early in his life. Many of his woodblock prints are of temples, bridges, in addition to landscapes he captured in his travels throughout Japan, Korea, and the United States. Hiratsuka was also a serious collector of old Buddhist prints, and his works are influenced by his exposure to Buddhist figures. He also had an extensive collection of roof tiles, Judaica and Bibles in every language, and when he was not practicing his art, spent hours reading. Hiratsuka's techniques and styles evolved over his lifetime. Pre-WWII blocks included many color woodblock prints and engravings, while after WWII, he worked almost exclusively on black-and-white prints. His most famous technique is called tsukibori ("poking strokes"). With a small square-end chisel (aisuki), Hiratsuka rocked the blade side to side in short strokes, producing rough and jagged edges. His students include Kobashi Yasuhide. Hiratsuka died in Tokyo, at the age of 102.

He belonged to Bhuyan tribe of Odisha. Nayak, an Odia folk-hero of Koraput of southernmost part of Orissa and a cult-figure among its tribals, was born in Tentuliguma village of the Koraput district and his father Padlam Nayak was a tribal chief and 'Mustadaar' under 'Jeypore Samasthanam' in the then Madras Presidency. The local administration worked as a subsidiary of the British Government. The tribals under their administration were treated badly by revenue officials, forest guides and police constables, and were subjected to torture. Nayak organised the rebels successfully against exploitation by the officials of Jeypore Samasthanam. This brought him recognition as a potential tribal leader and the National Congress admitted Nayak into its fold. During the course of his training in Naupuri training centre for Congress workers, Nayak had the opportunity to meet and interact with several Zonal and State level leaders which enabled him to broaden his horizons. His training inculcated in him a spirit for Nationalism and indoctrinated him with the Gandhian principles of truth, nonviolence and peaceful non-cooperation with the British Government. He carried a Charkha, with the message of adult education and abstinence from alcohol to every tribal household of his area and brought about a total change in the rural scenario. He became the of mission in the Congress campaign in the Koraput Sub-division during the first ever election in 1936. Responding to the call of Mahatma Gandhi, Nayak led a procession on 21 August 1942 and demonstrated peacefully in front of Mathili Police Station. The police however fired at the demonstrators indiscriminately, which killed forty and injured more than two hundred people. The administration implicated Nayak in a case of murder and the death sentence was pronounced on him on 13 November 1942. He was hanged on 29 March 1943 in Berhampur Jail.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lev_Lebedinsky	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miass	Lev Lebedinsky (1904–1992) was a Russian musicologist. He is perhaps most well known today as a friend and oft-quoted confidant of composer Dmitry Shostakovich. His part in the debate over Shostakovich's memoirs and musical intentions created a certain amount of conflict with the late composer's family after his death in 1975. He is quoted, perhaps most controversially, claiming that around the time of writing his dour and autobiographical Eighth Quartet, Shostakovich was suicidal — that Lebedinsky removed a bottle of sleeping pills from the composer's pocket. Lebedinsky's testimony is questioned by some because of his previously-held positions - as an agent for the Bolshevik secret police, Felix Dzerzhinsky’s notorious Cheka, and as a major leader of the RAPM (Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians) which officially opposed Shostakovich and other Soviet composers in the 1920s.

Dr. Takashi is best known for his efforts in helping the victims of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, despite his very serious injuries and the loss of his wife to the bomb, and for his plea to the world that it move on with the utilization of atomic energy for the progress of civilization so that the victims of the bombings may rest in peace. In the "Atomic-bomb rescue and relieve report" of October 1945 he has stated: "Everything was finished. Our mother land was defeated. Our university had collapsed and classrooms were reduced to ashes. We, one by one, were wounded and fell. The houses we lived in were burned down, the clothes we wore were blown up, and our families were either dead or injured. What are we going to say? We only wish to repeat this tragedy with the human race. We should use the principle of the atomic atom (sic). Go forward in the research of atomic energy contributing to the progress of civilization. A misfortune will be then transformed to a good fortune. The world civilization will change with the utilization of atomic energy. If a new and fortunate world can be made, the souls of so many victims will rest in peace."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malala_Yousafzai	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mingora	Malala Yousafzai S.St (Malālah Yūsafzay: Urdu: ملالہ یوسفزئی‎; Pashto: ملاله یوسفزۍ‎ [məˈlaːlə jusəf ˈzəj]; born 12 July 1997) is a Pakistani activist for female education and the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate. She is known mainly for human rights advocacy for education and for women in her native Swat Valley in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of northwest Pakistan, where the local Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school. Yousafzai's advocacy has since grown into an international movement. Her family runs a chain of schools in the region. In early 2009, when she was 11–12, Yousafzai wrote a blog under a pseudonym for the BBC Urdu detailing her life under Taliban occupation, their attempts to take control of the valley, and her views on promoting education for girls in the Swat Valley. The following summer, journalist Adam B. Ellick made a New York Times documentary about her life as the Pakistani military intervened in the region. Yousafzai rose in prominence, giving interviews in print and on television, and she was nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize by South African activist Desmond Tutu. On the afternoon of 9 October 2012, Yousafzai boarded her school bus in the northwest Pakistani district of Swat. A gunman asked for her by name, then pointed a pistol at her and fired three shots. One bullet hit the left side of Yousafzai's forehead, travelled under her skin through the length of her face, and went into her shoulder. In the days immediately following the attack, she remained unconscious and in critical condition, but later her condition improved enough for her to be sent to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, England, for intensive rehabilitation. On 12 October, a group of 50 Muslim clerics in Pakistan issued a fatwā against those who tried to kill her, but the Taliban reiterated their intent to kill Yousafzai and her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai. The assassination attempt sparked a national and international outpouring of support for Yousafzai. Deutsche Welle wrote in January 2013 that Yousafzai may have become "the most famous teenager in the world." United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education Gordon Brown launched a UN petition in Yousafzai's name, demanding that all children worldwide be in school by the end of 2015; it helped lead to the ratification of Pakistan's first Right to Education Bill. The 2013, 2014 and 2015 issues of Time magazine featured Yousafzai as one of "The 100 Most Influential People in the World". She was the winner of Pakistan's first National Youth Peace Prize, and the recipient of the 2013 Sakharov Prize. In July that year, she spoke at the headquarters of the United Nations to call for worldwide access to education, and in October the Government of Canada announced its intention that its parliament confer Honorary Canadian citizenship upon Yousafzai. In February 2014, she was nominated for the World Children's Prize in Sweden. Even though she was fighting for women's rights as well as children's rights, she did not describe herself as feminist when asked on Forbes Under 30 Summit in 2014. In 2015, however, Yousafzai told Emma Watson she decided to call herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech at the UN launching the HeForShe campaign. In May 2014, Yousafzai was granted an honorary doctorate by the University of King's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

He was known for defining a style of Haitian compas music he called kompa mamba, and for the sometimes bawdy innuendo used in his songs. During his career, he was one of Haïti's most prominent musicians, and found much success in West Africa as well. As a young man, he received a classical music education and worked as a cabinetmaker before becoming a professional soccer player. It was from soccer, playing defense for the Port-au-Prince club Aigles Noirs, that he acquired his nickname, "Coupé Cloué" or "cut and screw". He began performing on guitar in 1951, and in 1957 he formed the band Trio Crystal, which he later renamed Trio Select, along with another guitar player and a maraca player. Their first album, one of the dozens Henry released during his career, was released in the late 1960s. In the early 1970s the group expanded from its original three, and renamed itself Ensemble Select. That decade also saw an increase in his use of racy spoken preaching and storytelling in addition to singing during songs; this became one of his trademarks. In 1978 Coupé Cloué toured extensively in Africa, greatly increasing his international prominence. His popularity in West Africa was especially boosted by similarities between the rhythms and sounds of Henry's music and indigenous African soukous music. It was there that Henry earned the nickname Roi Coupé, or King Coupé. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Henry continued to perform and record prolifically. Henry died of diabetes in January 1998, having only retired from performing the previous month. He was mourned in Port-au-Prince by a day-long outdoor funeral celebration, attended by thousands of people, including the interim Minister of Culture.

Sato was initially an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear power. Like his predecessors he appreciated the jobs and subsidies associated with the nuclear plants in the prefecture. He believed it was part of Fukushima playing a role in the Japanese nation as a whole. In 1998 he conditionally agreed the controversial use of mixed oxide plutonium uranium fuel (MOX) at the Fukushima plant, withdrawing his support after discovering a cover-up of reactor malfunctions and cracks. Between 2002 and 2006 twenty-one problems at the Fukushima plant were reported to his office. The whistleblowers, including some employees at the plant, bypassed both Tepco and Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency because they feared that their information would go straight to Tepco. This was later shown to be a very justified fear. Sato became an increasingly bitter critic of the plant and Japan's entire energy policy as directed by NISA's powerful government overseer, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. In 2006 Sato was forced to step down and in 2008 was prosecuted and convicted on bribery charges. He claims the charges were politically motivated. Following the conviction he wrote a book of his experiences called Annihilating a Governor explaining his concerns about nuclear power and how he was set up and wrongfully convicted. The book was largely ignored until the events of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster sent it rocketing up the bestseller list.

In the 1990s he ran a successful business. He is also a member of the Russian Academy of Science. In 1999 and 2003 he was elected deputy of the State Duma from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF). In the 2003 election he was the second ranked member on the CPRF list. The following year his ambitions of party leadership led him into conflict with the communist leader Gennady Zuganov. Many old communists viewed rich Semigin as an opportunist, not a true member of the opposition. They labeled him a "mole" and the "Red oligarch". Despite this, Semigin was still elected chairman of the “People’s Patriotic Union of Russia”, an umbrella organization that united the Communist party with minor opposition parties. Semigin made several attempts to seize power from Zuganov, including organisation of separate CPRF congress. But VTsIK didn't recognize Semigin's congress and pointed that only the official CPRF congress was legal. This congress voted to expel Semigin and his allies from the party. In the Duma, Semigin moved to the Rodina faction, and at the same time founded his own party Patriots of Russia. He also organized the "People's Government" – the group of leftists politicians including Sergey Glazyev, Gennady Seleznev and Gennady Gudkov that pretended to be a "future government".

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rajinder_Goel	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Narwana	Rajinder Goel (born 20 September 1942 in Narwana, Haryana) is a former cricketer who holds the record for most wickets in Ranji Trophy, India's premier first class competition, despite which he was never selected to play for India. A left arm spinner, he represented Patiala, Southern Punjab, Delhi and Haryana in domestic cricket. The son of an assistant station master in the Indian Railways, Goel came up through the Vaish school and college in Rohtak. His first major success was for North Zone schools in 1957 when he took four wickets against West Zone in the final of the All-India schools tournament and was declared the best bowler of the competition. He made his Ranji debut in the next season. Goel credits his early success to his teacher and coach Kishan Dayal. He started his first class career with Patiala, which then evolved into the Southern Punjab team. He moved to Delhi in 1963 and Haryana ten years later. Goel appeared for India against Ceylon in an unofficial Test at Ahmedabad in 1964-65 where he took 4 for 33 in the second innings. Thereafter, the presence of the "Indian spin quartet", especially Bishen Bedi who bowled in a similar style, restricted his appearances for India. When Bedi was dropped from the team for the Bangalore Test against West Indies in 1974-75 on disciplinary grounds for appearing in a BBC interview, Goel was selected to the Indian team but was excluded at the last moment. He also took 6-102 and 3-43 against the Australians in 1979-80. Goel rated his 12-134 against the South Zone in the final of the 1975-76 Duleep Trophy as his most satisfying performance. Goel went past V. V. Kumar's Ranji record of 417 wckets in the 1978-79 season. His 600th wicket was Chandrakant Pandit, caught at deep squareleg in the Ranji semifinal against Bombay in 1983-84. He retired after taking 39 wickets in 1984-85 season. Goel's 637 wickets is a record by a long way, Srinivas Venkataraghavan with 530 wickets being the next best. He took more than 25 Ranji wickets in a season fifteen times, including in his last nine seasons. Haryana reached the Ranji semi-final thrice during Goel's time but lost on each occasion. Their first appearance in the final happened in the season after his retirement. Goel is one of two non-Test cricketers, the other being Padmakar Shivalkar, who Sunil Gavaskar chose among his "idols" in his book the same name. "He is the one bowler whom I have really dreaded facing in my life," he wrote about Goel. "I have never been able to feel comfortable against his left hand spinners and Goel has been one who, because of his flatter trajectory, has not given me the opportunity to step down the track and drive." However, Gavaskar considered Bedi the greater bowler overall. During his playing days, Goel was employed with the State Bank of India. He later served as a selector for Haryana and the Indian junior teams. His son Nitin Goel was also a first class cricketer for Haryana.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaud_Chapdelaine	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolet,_Quebec	Renaud Chapdelaine (March 27, 1911 – September 1, 1971) was a Quebec lawyer and was briefly a Member of Parliament in the Canadian House of Commons. Chapdelaine won an upset victory in a February 1949 by-election in Nicolet—Yamaska - the first francophone riding to be won in Quebec since the Conservative Party relaunched itself as the Progressive Conservatives in 1942. While in the previous election, the Progressive Conservative candidate received only 944 votes, Chapdelaine received 8,382 votes, just over 49% of the total vote and almost 300 votes more than his rival, Liberal Paul Trahan. The victory, in a riding that had not voted Tory since 1911, was seen as a major breakthrough for the Progressive Conservatives and for its new leader George A. Drew, one which made much more likely a Tory victory in the next federal election. He was a supporter of the Union Nationale provincially and credited his victory to the voter support for the principle of an autonomous province opposed to the centralization of federal powers - a policy supported by both the UN and the Tories. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent blamed Chapdelaine's victory on the presence of a third candidate, an Independent Liberal, who they argued split the Liberal vote. The Liberals subsequently claimed that Chapdelaine had run on isolationist and Quebec nationalist policies critical of the government's involvement in World War II and that his true allegiance was not to Drew but to Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis. In March 1949, Chapdelaine and Georges Heon, an Independent Conservative MP who had recently joined the Progressive Conservative caucus, signed a joint statement calling for improving the rights of Franco-Ontarians in regards to French language Separate Schools in Ontario. The Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario had traditionally opposed the extension of both funding for Catholic Separate Schools and French language education and Drew had been, until recently, the Premier of Ontario and leader of the provincial Tory party. Chapdelaine was defeated four months after his initial victory, in the June 1949 federal election, as were the Progressive Conservatives nationally. While he increased his vote total to over 9,000 that was not enough to overcome Liberal contender Maurice Boisvert who defeated him by almost 400 votes in a straight two candidate race. Chapdelaine returned to private life and did not run in another federal election.

He is believed by his devotees to be Krishna himself who appeared in the form of His own devotee in order to teach the people of this world the process of Bhakti and how to attain the perfection of life. He is considered as the most merciful manifestation of Krishna. Chaitanya was the proponent for the Vaishnava school of Bhakti yoga (meaning loving devotion to God), based on Bhagavata Purana and Bhagavad Gita. Of various incarnations of Vishnu, he is revered as Krishna, popularised the chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra and composed the Siksastakam (eight devotional prayers) in Sanskrit. His followers, Gaudiya Vaishnavas, revere him as a Krishna with the mood and complexion of his source of inspiration Radha. Chaitanya is sometimes referred to by the names Gauranga or Gaura due to his fair complexion, and Nimai due to his being born underneath a Neem tree. There is no evidence, however, that he was born under a Neem Tree. He was very mischievous in his young days. His original name was Vishambhar. He was a brilliant student and Nimai was his nickname. At an early age he became a scholar and opened a school.

A pillar of the Meiji-era literary establishment, and the editor of Kobe Shinbun and Taiheiyo as well as Senshibankō and Kozakuraodoshi, his writing is marred for modern readers by its imperialist outlook, one example being Osero, a new version of Othello commissioned for the Otojiro Kawakami troupe and set in the Taiwan of 1903, in which the Othello figure, the governor Lt. Gen. Muro Washirō, is a Japanese burakumin who has been sent to the island to suppress a rebellion.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charan_Singh	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Noorpur,_Uttar_Pradesh	Chaudhary Charan Singh (23 December 1902 – 29 May 1987) was the Prime Minister of the Republic of India, serving from 28 July 1979 until 14 January 1980. Charan Singh was born in a small peasant Jat family (tenants to the local Zamindari of Kuchesar) in 1902 in village Noorpur of Hapur District in Uttar Pradesh Charan Singh entered politics as part of Independence Movement motivated by Mohandas Gandhi. He was active from 1931 in the Ghaziabad District Arya Samaj as well as the Meerut District Indian National Congress for which he was jailed twice by the British. Before independence, as part of the 1937 United Provinces Assembly, he took deep interest in the state of laws that were detrimental to the village economy and he slowly built his ideological and practical stand against the exploitation of tillers of the land by landlords. He became particularly notable in Uttar Pradesh since the 1950s for drafting and ensuring the passage of what were then the most revolutionary Land Reform laws in any state in India under the tutelage of the then Chief Minister Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant; first as Parliamentary Secretary and then as Revenue Minister responsible for Land Reforms. He became visible on the national stage from 1959 when he had the strength of conviction to publicly oppose the unquestioned leader and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's socialistic and collectivist land policies in the Nagpur Congress Session. Though his position in the faction ridden UP Congress was weakened, this was in a way the starting point of the middle peasant communities across castes in North India looking up to him as their spokesperson and later as their unquestioned leader. The leader of the Bharatiya Lok Dal, a major constituent of the Janata coalition, he was disappointed in his ambition to become Prime Minister in 1977 by Jayaprakash Narayan's choice of Morarji Desai, not to seek power for himself but to enable him implement his revolutionary economic programs in the interest of the rural economy. Unfortunately, few amongst his rural based part had the intellectual heft to fully comprehend his wide ranging agenda to remake Indian society and economy, and this weakness dogged him his entire career specially in Delhi. Urban intellectuals were mostly beholden to either the communist / socialist models, or were neo-liberal and capitalist and hence looked askance at his uniquely Indian solution. During 1977 Lok Sabha Elections, the fragmented opposition united a few months before the elections under the Janata Party banner, for which Ch Charan Singh had been struggling almost single handedly since 1974 when the Congress rigged the state elections in Uttar Pradesh in their favor. It was because of efforts of Raj Narain he later became Prime Minister in the year 1979 though Raj Narain was Chairman of Janata Party-Secular and assured Charan Singh of elevating him as Prime Minister, the way he helped him to become Chief Minister in the year 1967 in Uttar Pradesh. However, he resigned after just 24 days in office since Indira Gandhi's Congress Party withdrew support to the government. Charan Singh said he resigned because he was not ready to be blackmailed into withdrawing Indira Gandhi's emergency related court cases. Chaudhary Charan Singh's government did not face the Lok Sabha during his brief tenure as the Indian National Congress withdrew their support from his Government as he refused to agree to the terms of the Congress to protect Indira Gandhi and her associates from prosecution under the laws of the land. Charan Singh resigned and fresh elections were held six months later. He continued to lead the Lok Dal in opposition till his death in 1987.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hon'inbō_Jōwa	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nagano,_Nagano	Honinbo Jowa (本因坊丈和, original name Todani Matsunosuke, 1787–1847) served as 12th Hon'inbō from 1827 and Meijin Godokoro from 1831 until 1839, when he was forced into retirement. Jōwa was born in Nagano, Japan, in 1787. It was said that Jōwa had great strength without equal. Historically he was accorded the title "latter sage" to match Dōsaku who was known as the "former sage". At some point in the Meiji Era this title was transferred to the more popular Shūsaku, as word was spread that Jōwa used the contacts that Hayashi Genbi had within the government to help him attain the Meijin Godokoro position. However, even without playing a sogo, Jōwa's strength was still apparent. Later on in his life, Jōwa also played one of the most famous games in Go history known as the "Blood-vomiting game". Gennan Inseki, a rival of Jōwa's who had seen the coveted position of Meijin godokoro snatched away from him through less than honorable means, persuaded a rapidly improving pupil of his, Akaboshi Intetsu, to play a game on black against Jōwa. Although Gennan, an 8-dan, would probably take black the majority of the time against Jōwa in a challenge match, he thought it would be more effective to have Akaboshi, a 7-dan, play against Jōwa. If Jōwa lost, he intended to argue that Jōwa could certainly not be qualified to be Meijin if he couldn't defeat a 7-dan. The match started with Jōwa making an unreasonably aggressive move in the fuseki, and Akaboshi countering with a variation of the taisha joseki that was developed secretly in the Inoue house. However, as the four-day-long game progressed, Jowa slowly clawed his way into the lead by playing three famous moves known as the "Ghost Moves". The three moves were supposedly brought to Jōwa by ghosts, allowing him to grind Intetsu's lead away. In the end, Jōwa won, and as the stones were being cleared from the board, Akaboshi kneeled over the board and coughed up blood. Within a few weeks, he was dead. Gennan's tactics for discrediting Jowa's worthiness of being appointed Meijin backfired spectacularly, as this game was the supreme triumph of Jōwa's career.

He is currently with the Tokyo Yakult Swallows in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball. Despite having one of the best fastballs and sliders of anyone in the league, Arakaki has battled control problems and injuries throughout his career. In 2007, Arakaki set the NPB record for most wild pitches in a season with 21, breaking Kazuhisa Ishii's record. Arakaki was first seen at the 1998 Koshien summer tournament, and caught the eyes of many scouts with his fastball and sharp break on his slider. Despite his team not going far in the tournament, he was scouted by the Orix BlueWave and offered a contract. However, Arakaki turned it down stating that he did not intend to play for Orix. Incidentally, Katsutoshi Miwata who scouted Arakaki subsequently jumped to his death from an apartment building. In both 2008 and 2009, Arakaki had been in and out of the lineup due to persistent shoulder problems. From the end of '07 to late '08, the righty did not win a start, a stretch that spanned from September 17, 2007, to August 28, 2008. In the 2008 campaign, Arakaki finished with a 4-6 record and a 4.18 ERA. The 2009 season was far less kind, as the embattled righty went 0-2 with a 7.91 ERA whilst battling shoulder injuries. He did not pitch at the Major League level in 2010 and 2011 due to injury. He finally cracked the Opening Day roster in 2012 for his first action in nearly three years.

He is the 1971 U.S. national champion and North American champion. He placed 6th at the 1968 Winter Olympics and 5th at the 1972 Winter Olympics. His best finish at the World Championships was 4th in 1972; he placed 5th in 1969, 1970, and 1971. In 1972, he won the gold medal at the World University Games. Petkevich was coached by Arthur Bourke and Gustave Lussi. He was known as a particularly dynamic free skater for his time. His emphasis on freer musical expression and less rigid body lines set him apart from most other men's singles competitors of his era. He has also been credited with innovating fashion for male competitors by wearing a more athletic costume of a jumpsuit and turtleneck sweater rather than the more formal suit-and-tie outfit that was otherwise universal in the 1960s. By the early 1970s, many other skaters had emulated Petkevich's costume style. In 1970, while a student at Harvard University, Petkevich founded An Evening with Champions, a long-running annual ice show that raises money to benefit the Jimmy Fund and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Petkevich was the recipient of an unusual trophy. At the 1947 World Figure Skating Championships, Ulrich Salchow was particularly impressed by Dick Button's skating, and gave him one of his own trophies. Following the 1972 Olympics, Button passed on Salchow's trophy to Petkevich. In 2010, Petkevich passed the trophy to Paul Wylie, keeping alive the meaning of the trophy which is meant to reward a skater for having had a material impact on the sport. Following his competitive career, Petkevich attended University of Oxford as a Rhodes scholar, earning a Ph.D. in cell biology in 1978. He subsequently studied music privately, was a Fellow in the Music Department at Harvard, and was composer-in-residence at Eliot House, Harvard. In 1983, he joined Hambrecht & Quist as a securities analyst following the biotechnology industry. From 1987 to 1989, he pursued healthcare investment banking. In 1989, he joined Robertson Stephens & Co. as Managing Director and served several roles including Head of Healthcare Banking and Head of Investment Banking. In 2008, he founded The Petkevich Group, a boutique advisory firm where he was Chairman and CEO from 1998 to 2005. In 2006, He co-founded along with Dennis McCoy, MD, BladeRock Capital, the General Partner of the V2MTM Life Sciences Fund. The Fund makes contrarian investments in undervalued public companies, which are developing medical breakthrough products that address large, unmet medical needs. Petkevich is the author of Figure Skating: Championship Techniques (ISBN 0-452-26209-7), one of the standard reference works on figure skating technique. He has also served as a figure skating analyst for NBC, CBS, and ESPN. Petkevich has also composed a Clarinet Quintet, a Piano Trio, A Sonata for Piano and a number of songs in different genre. Most have the compositions have been played in small concerts.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keith_Brueckner	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minneapolis	Keith Allen Brueckner (March 19, 1924 – September 19, 2014) was an American theoretical physicist who made important contributions in several areas of physics, including many-body theory in condensed matter physics, and laser fusion. He was born in Minneapolis on March 19, 1924. He earned a B.A. and M.A. in mathematics from the University of Minnesota in 1945 and 1947 and a Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1950. He died on September 19, 2014 at the age of 90. After completing his Ph.D. he joined the physics faculty at Indiana University (1951–1955) and then at the University of Pennsylvania (1956–1959). In 1959, Brueckner was recruited by Roger Revelle to come to University of California, San Diego, where he became one of the founders of the Department of Physics. Brueckner was instrumental in recruiting many faculty members to the new campus, as well as setting up the curriculum for the School of Science and Engineering. Over the course of his career at UC San Diego, Brueckner served as Director of the Institute of Radiation Physics and Aerodynamics and, later, Director of the Institute for Pure and Applied Physical Sciences. He and Murray Gell-Mann collaborated to show that the random phase approximation (RPA) can be derived by summing a series of Feynman diagrams. The relevance and correctness of RPA were heavily debated at the time. This was a seminal result, as it is often considered to be the first major accomplishment of modern quantum many-particle theory and has been an inspiration for the entire field.

However, it caused controversy because the bout had initially been awarded to Taihō by the referee before being reversed by the judges, but photographs published in newspapers the next day suggested that Toda had stepped out first and Taihō should have been given the victory after all. This embarrassment led to the Sumo Association introducing instant replay to assist judges in future decisions.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Thompson_(sociologist)	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minneapolis	John Brookshire Thompson is a Sociology professor at the University of Cambridge and a fellow of Jesus College. He gained his first degree in philosophy, sociology and social anthropology at Keele University in 1975. He has studied the influence of the media in the formation of modern societies, a subject on which he is one of the few social theorists to focus. One of the key themes of his work is the role of the media in the transformation of space and time in social life, and the creation of new forms of action and interaction beyond temporal and spatial frameworks. Influenced strongly by hermeneutics, he studies communication and its uses, and links it closely with social context. Other key concepts are the transformation of visibility, the media and tradition, and identity and the symbolic project. His book Ideology and Mass Culture is a study of what the theory of ideology entails in modern society. William Outhwaite of the University of Sussex dubs it "a pathbreaking work which will undoubtedly become one of the fundamental texts in the theory of ideology." Thompson's essay "The New Visibility" is employed as the basis for the study of media at Rhodes University, while his tome Political Scandal: Power and Visibility in the Media Age has been described by Amy Binder of Clemson University as "excellent". His work stands out for its recognition of the importance of the nature and development of mass communication.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenji_Doihara	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Okayama	Kenji Doihara (土肥原 賢二 Doihara Kenji, 8 August 1883 – 23 December 1948) was a general in the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II. He was instrumental in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria for which he earned fame taking the nickname 'Lawrence of Manchuria', a reference to the Lawrence of Arabia, although according to Jamie Bisher this flattering sobriquet was rather misapplied given that Colonel T.E. Lawrence fought to liberate, not to oppress a people. Furthermore, according to the opinion of his military chief in Manchuria, Lieutenant-General Ishiwara Kanji, his heavy addiction to opium contributed to his unreliability as an army officer. As a leading intelligence officer he played a key role to the Japanese machinations leading to the occupation of large parts of China, the destabilization of the country and the disintegration of the traditional structure of the Chinese society in order to diminish reaction to the Japanese plans using highly unconventional methods. He became the mastermind of the Manchurian drug trade, and the real boss and sponsor behind every kind of gang and underworld activity in China (see Controversy section). After the end of World War II, he was prosecuted for war crimes in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. He was found guilty, sentenced to death and was hanged in December 1948.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minor_White	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minneapolis	Minor Martin White (July 9, 1908 – June 24, 1976) was an American photographer, theoretician, critic and educator. He combined an intense interest in how people viewed and understood photographs with a personal vision that was guided by a variety of spiritual and intellectual philosophies. Starting in Oregon in 1937 and continuing until he died in 1976, White made thousands of black-and-white and color photographs of landscapes, people and abstract subject matter, created with both technical mastery and a strong visual sense of light and shadow. He taught many classes, workshops and retreats on photography at the California School of Fine Arts, Rochester Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, other schools, and in his own home. He lived much of his life as a closeted gay man, afraid to express himself publicly for fear of loss of his teaching jobs, and some of his most compelling images are figure studies of men whom he taught or with whom he had relationships. He helped start and for many years was editor of the photography magazine Aperture. After his death in 1976, White was hailed as one of America's greatest photographers.

He was previously a United States Senator for Minnesota from 2001 to 2007, and the Minnesota State Auditor from 1991 to 1995. He is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), which affiliates with the national Democratic Party. A native of Minnesota, Dayton is the great-grandson of businessman George Dayton, the founder of Dayton's, a department store that later became the Target Corporation. He embarked on a career in teaching and social work in New York City and Boston after graduating from Yale University in 1969. During the 1970s, he served as a legislative aide to U.S. Senator Walter Mondale and Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich. In 1978, Dayton was appointed the Minnesota Economic Development Commissioner and married Alida Rockefeller Messinger, a member of the Rockefeller family. Dayton gained national attention in 1982 during his unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign against Republican Party incumbent David Durenberger. He defeated former U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy in the Democratic primary, and the general election became one of the most expensive in state history. Dayton campaigned as a populist in opposition to Reaganomics and famously promised "to close tax loopholes for the rich and the corporations – and if you think that includes the Daytons, you're right". After his defeat, Dayton returned to the Perpich administration until his election as Minnesota State Auditor in 1990. In 1998, Dayton ran an unsuccessful campaign for governor, losing the Democratic nomination to Hubert Humphrey III. In 2000, he was elected to the U.S. Senate after defeating Republican incumbent Rod Grams. As Senator, Dayton voted against the authorization for Iraq War, and became the first Senator to introduce legislation creating a cabinet-level United States Department of Peace. In 2006, he chose not to seek reelection, citing his disillusionment with Washington, D.C. and fundraising. In 2010, Dayton defeated Republican Tom Emmer to become Governor of Minnesota despite national success for the Republican Party, including in the Minnesota legislature. His major legislative initiatives as Governor include the legalization of same-sex marriage and the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium for the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL).

Moving to Miami as a young woman to work for The Miami Herald, Douglas became a freelance writer, producing over a hundred short stories that were published in popular magazines. Her most influential work was the book The Everglades: River of Grass (1947), which redefined the popular conception of the Everglades as a treasured river instead of a worthless swamp; its impact has been compared to that of Rachel Carson's influential book Silent Spring (1962). Her books, stories, and journalism career brought her influence in Miami, which she used to advance her causes. Even as a young woman Douglas was outspoken and politically conscious of many issues that included women's suffrage and civil rights. She was called upon to take a central role in the protection of the Everglades when she was 79 years old. For the remaining 29 years of her life she was "a relentless reporter and fearless crusader" for the natural preservation and restoration of the nature of South Florida. Her tireless efforts earned her several variations of the nickname "Grande Dame of the Everglades" as well as the hostility of agricultural and business interests looking to benefit from land development in Florida. Numerous awards were given to her, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and she was inducted into several halls of fame. Douglas lived until age 108, working until nearly the end of her life for Everglades restoration. Upon her death, an obituary in The Independent in London stated, "In the history of the American environmental movement, there have been few more remarkable figures than Marjory Stoneman Douglas."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Alan_Yule	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minneapolis	Paul Alan Yule is an archaeologist at the Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg (habilitation). He studied at the University of Minnesota (BA), New York University (MA and PhD) and Marburg University. His main work targets the archaeology of India, Oman, and Yemen. Yule's dissertation, Early Cretan Seals, classifies and dates the seals from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages on Minoan Crete. In the 1980s, with the support of Swami Omanand Saraswati, he catalogued and evaluated metallic artefacts of the so-called Copper Hoard Culture by means of European methods and models for the first time, whereby numerous finds came to light especially in the Kanya Gurukul in Narela/Haryana. These artefacts appear to be non-functional objects, probably used in rituals or simply deposited in hoards, to judge from a lack of use-wear. Far away in Odisha, Yule published a find from a metals period cemetery in Sankarjang which may be the earliest musical instrument in India. He documented the early historic fortress at Sisupalgarh by means of a laser scanner, ground penetrating radar and a hand-held GPS receiver. Together with Corinna Borchert, Yule uncovered illegal building development within this nationally protected Mauryan site. From 2001-2004 in India, Yule documented so-called mud forts and other archaeological sites for the first time, especially in Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Images of his work especially in Orissa appear in the image bank HeidICON. Yule's study of the prehistory of Oman began in the 1980s at the site of Samad al-Shan which sheds light on the protoliterate Late Iron Age population of central Oman. It comes into view as early as 250-100 BCE or later and we lose track of it around 300 CE far prior to the arrival of Islam in Oman. The chronology of the Samad Late Iron Age is the most controversial part of his published work, which in later publications he adjusted, especially after 2006. The site Samad yields eastern Arabian artefacts of different periods. A further project, the cataloguing of the metal hoard find from Ibri-Selme, which he published with Gerd Weisgerber, studies the largest hoard of metallic artefacts to occur in the Near East. Stashed in an Umm an-Nar period communal tomb, these date to the Early Iron Age. New excavations were intended to add greater definition to the Iron Age. New was the introduction of alphanumeric abbreviations for site and artefact classes to enable computer processing. In the mid 1990s Yule and Weisgerber mapped and studied the Bronze Age tower tombs of Jaylah on the Jebel Akhdar, which may date to the Umm an-Nar Period mid-late 3rd millennium BCE. Yule sought late antique habitation in his excavation at the oasis site of Izki/al-Yemen. Yule updated much of his thought on Oman in 2014. He distinguishes and defines Early and Late Iron Ages. In the Sultanate, the Late Iron Age has two facies. The one known from the most sites is designated Samad Late Iron Age, the other is the période préislamique récente  which mostly French and Belgian colleagues researched and defined in the United Arab Emirates. At the site of Zafar, capital of the Himyarite Tribal Confederation, in the Yemenite highlands, field operations continued from 1998 to 2010 with a budget which eventually amounted to 5,300,000 Euros. This project illuminates especially the material culture of the Himyarite period (110 BCE - 525 CE). Yule excavated most notably a 1.70 m high relief-statue depicted wearing a crown which depicts arguably a Christian (Aksumite?) king. He argues that Himyarite culture is not really foreign to Islam which follows, but actually is a sire which passed on its genes. One wonders what Islamic religion and culture would be like without this influence. Excavated finds contradict the characterisation of Himyarite culture especially visual arts as decadent - a term which can be understood in different ways. Yule considered late pre-Islam in the Yemen to be his most important scientific contribution owing to the opportunity to work for several years and the large number of finds. In 2013 Steffen Wenig asked him to participate in an excavation project at Mifsas Bahri in the South Tigray Region. This work was enabled in 2014 by means of a grant from the DFG. This centres on the excavation of a church ruin presumably of the 7th century CE. Within the framework of the Open Access movement Yule emphasises the archiving of his research materials and publications as soon as possible so as to make them publicly available. He does this largely by means of the image bank HeidICON.

Swedien is a five-time Grammy winner and has been nominated 13 times. He recorded, mixed, and assisted in producing the best-selling album in the world, Thriller by Michael Jackson. He was the primary sound engineer for Jackson's studio recordings from 1978 to 2001. He also recorded and mixed for jazz artists such as Count Basie, Art Blakey, Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton, Quincy Jones, Oscar Peterson, Herbie Hancock and Jeff Oster. His pop work includes Patti Austin, Natalie Cole, Roberta Flack, Mick Jagger, David Hasselhoff, Jennifer Lopez, Paul McCartney, Diana Ross, Rufus, Chaka Khan, Barbra Streisand, Lena Horne, Donna Summer, Sarah Vaughan, and the zouk band Kassav'. He worked on the scores for Night Shift, The Color Purple and Running Scared. On 10 November 2001, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in philosophy from the Luleå University of Technology, Sweden for his achievements as a sound engineer. Swedien also held "masterclasses" at the Swedish National Radio for practicing sound engineers. On 30 August 2015, he was presented the Pensado Giant Award at the second annual Pensado Awards held at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, CA. The award was presented by Quincy Jones. Although born in Minneapolis, Bruce started his studio career in Chicago, working at Universal Studios under chief engineer Bill Putnam. He first met Quincy Jones there while Jones was vice president for Mercury Records in Chicago. The two worked on albums for artists like Dinah Washington and Sarah Vaughan. Bruce later moved to Brunswick Records in the late 1960s and 1970s where he ran and developed the label's studios and sound. The label, under producer Carl Davis, was responsible for numerous R&B and pop hits during that time, with artists such as The Chi-Lites, Tyrone Davis and Jackie Wilson. Swedien is noted for pioneering the 'Acusonic Recording Process' which involves pairing up microphones together on vocals and instruments, a technique enabled by synchronizing several multi-track recorders with SMPTE timecode. This achieved an enhanced roomy ambient sound, some of which is evident on albums produced in collaboration with Quincy Jones on tracks such as "Sounds And Stuff Like That!!", George Benson's "Give Me the Night", and the Michael Jackson albums he worked on.

In 1799 he became involved in the compilation of the Dai Nihon-shi (Great History of Japan) being undertaken by the Mito school. In 1825 he wrote his Shinron ("New Theses"), a collection of essays that dealt with issues such as Tokugawa defence policy and the perceived threat that Western ships presented to Japan. Aizawa also tried to describe conditions in the West and theorize why Western states had become so powerful; in his opinion Westerners used religion to enforce conformity of the masses. He believed that Japan would need to take up its own state religion and discussed the concept of kokutai ("national polity"), in this context. The Shinron would become an important work for the sonnō jōi movement and his theory of the Kokutai would be developed by future thinkers. In 1840 Aizawa became the first head of professors of the Mito school's Kōdōkan but was forced to resign in 1844 when Tokugawa Nariaki resigned as domain leader. He later returned to the Kōdōkan.

She has also won the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize, the Ambassador Book Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award. In 2012 she was awarded The Sunday Times Award for Literary Excellence. She is recognized for her fully developed characters, her “brilliantly imagined and absolutely accurate detail,” and her “rigorous and artful style” and “astute and open language.” While many of her characters have been described as quirky or eccentric, she has managed to make them seem real through skillfully fleshing out their inner lives in great depth. Her subject in all her novels has been the American family and marriage: the boredom and exasperating irritants endured by partners, children, siblings, parents; the desire for freedom pulling against the tethers of attachments and conflicted love; the evolution over time of familial love and sense of duty. Tyler celebrates unremarkable Americans and the ordinary details of their everyday lives. Because of her style and subject matter, she has been compared to John Updike, to Jane Austen, and to Eudora Welty, among others.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earl_Bakken	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minneapolis	Earl E. Bakken (born January 10, 1924 in Hennepin County, Minnesota) is an American engineer, businessman and philanthropist of Dutch and Norwegian American ancestry. He founded Medtronic, where he developed the first external, battery-operated, transistorized, wearable artificial pacemaker in 1957. Born in Columbia Heights, Minnesota, Bakken had a long-held fascination with electricity and electronics. A self-described "nerd", Bakken designed a rudimentary electroshock weapon in school to fend off bullies. After earning a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1948, he studied electrical engineering with a minor in mathematics at the University of Minnesota Graduate School. Post-World War II hospitals were just starting to employ electronic equipment, but did not have staff to maintain and repair them. Sensing an opportunity, with his brother-in-law, Palmer Hermundslie, he formed Medtronic (the combination of "medical" and "electronic") in a small garage, primarily working with the University of Minnesota hospital. In the 1950s, Dr. C. Walton Lillehei was performing life-saving surgery on children with blue baby syndrome. That surgery often left the children needing to be temporarily attached to a pacemaker. The pacemakers at the time were large devices that required their own carts and relied on wall current for power. As a result of a power blackout on October 31, 1957, one of Dr. Lillehei's young patients died. Dr. Lillehei, who had worked with Bakken before, asked him the next day if he could solve the problem. Four weeks after finding a circuit diagram for a metronome in Popular Electronics, Bakken delivered a battery-powered transistorized pacemaker about the size of a few decks of cards to Dr. Lillehei. After successfully testing the hand-made device in the laboratory, Bakken returned to create a refined model for patients. However, much to his astonishment, when he came in the next day, he found the pacemaker already in use on a patient. (The Food and Drug Administration did not start regulating medical devices until 1976.) Over the next several years, Bakken and Medtronic worked with other doctors to develop fully implantable pacemakers, but they also veered toward bankruptcy. He borrowed money that kept Medtronic going, but the bankruptcy near-miss drove Bakken to develop the Medtronic Mission, which still guides the company. The mission helped the young company to stay focused on areas where it could truly help patients. Bakken retired from Medtronic in 1989 and moved to a 9-acre estate in the Kona District of Hawaii he calls Bakken Hale, but still returns to the company several times a year to meet new employees and explain the Medtronic Mission to them in person. In 1996 he helped to dedicate the North Hawaii Community Hospital and has been active there ever since, working to combine Eastern and Western approaches to medicine to develop a more holistic approach to health care.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nelson_Olmsted	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minneapolis	Nelson Olmsted, (January 28, 1914, Minneapolis, Minnesota - April 8, 1992, Torrance, California) was an actor in films, recordings, radio and television from the 1950s to the 1970s. Sometimes billed as Nelson Olmstead, he was best known for an unusual NBC radio series, Sleep No More (1956–57), in which he narrated his own adaptations of terror tales and science-fantasy stories. Ben Grauer was the program's announcer. After study at the University of Texas, Olmsted began in radio in the late 1930s as an announcer for WBAP in Fort Worth, Texas. When he launched Black Night (1937–39), a late night 30-minute horror series, it was only a local program, but it created a sensation, with mail arriving at WBAP from ten states. A review in Radio News took note of the chilling music (by Gene Baugh) and horrific sound effects (by A.M. Woodford). Produced by Ken Douglass, the series began November 5, 1937 with Edgar Allan Poe's "The Tell Tale Heart" and then continued on with original scripts by Virginia Wiltten. Olmsted starred and was heard in a variety of different roles. Within a year, the impact of Black Night catapulted Olmsted to New York, where he was immediately established as NBC's resident storyteller, a position he held for over a decade, beginning with The World's Greatest Short Stories (1939, 1944, 1947) and Dramas by Olmsted (1940–41). Today, Olmsted is best remembered for his spoken word recordings released by the Vanguard Recording Society. One of these was the LP version of Sleep No More! The album's back cover featured a box in which Olmsted delivered a capsule summary of his life: Now that I think of it, we had a sort of Golden Age of Drama down in Austin, Texas, during those depressed middle thirties. There was the Curtain Club of the University of Texas and Austin’s Little Theatre, and working between them were such aspirants as Zachary Scott, Elaine Anderson Scott, Eli Wallach, Walter Cronkite, Brooks West and Alma Holloway, whom I had sense enough to marry. Most of them came on to New York, fought the actor’s battle, and made it one way or another. I stayed behind with the security of a radio announcer’s job. By the time I moved to WBAP, in Fort Worth, this security was pulling, and the announcer’s life seemed endlessly sterile. What to do about it? Dramatic shows cost money and there were no budgets. The cheapest drama for radio I could think of was good literature, read aloud. Especially the work of that great dramatist who never wrote a play -- Edgar Allan Poe. WBAP gave me some time with which to experiment. That was way back in 1939 -- and it worked. By 1940, the storytelling show was on NBC for a ten-year run. There were a couple of years out for the Army, but even so I managed to tell stories over the Army radio network in Italy. Television brought rough competition to the industry. Rather than fight, I joined by adapting some of the best stories into plays, selling them to Fred Coe, and playing a part in them -- sometimes the lead. So -- in the long run -- I got to New York, too, and made it as an actor, literally by telling stories!

Tomori won the Japan's inter-high school championship in the 45 kg class in 1977, and compiled an amateur record of 16–4 (3 KOs) before turning professional. Hitoshi Misako who is the president of Misako Boxing Gym in Tokyo went to Okinawa, and encouraged Tomori to turn professional. After joining that gym in 1978, he made his professional debut at the Korakuen Hall in May of that year. In March 1979, Tomori won the annual Japanese boxing series, All-Japan Rookie King Tournament in the junior flyweight division. Although he lost on points to Kazunori Tenryū in the Japanese junior flyweight title bout in November 1979, he knocked out the sixteen-time defending champion Tenryū in the first round of the return match in February 1980 to capture the title. However he lost on points to Shūichi Hozumi in his second defense in August of that year. He competed with Masaharu Inami for the vacated title, but it also ended in a failure. Originally Tomori was an out-fighter who excelled in the speed and skill. During his professional career, he had almost mastered the in-fighting to be spotlighted. However his transformation into an in-fighter was still incomplete. So, his manager Misako made him go to the temple for the sitting meditation practice in order to discipline his mind. Tomori regained the vacant Japanese title via a close decision in October 1981, and defended it once via a unanimous decision in his first professional fight in his hometown of Naha. At that time, Misako sensed that Tomori got a boost of energy, and set a world title shot for him. On April 13, 1982, Tomori was scheduled to fight against Amado Ursúa for the WBC junior flyweight title at the Korakuen Hall. He trained under the guidance of Eddie Townsend who signed a deal with Misako Boxing Gym in March of that year. After the champion's pre-fight open workout, Koichi Wajima, Tomori's senior in the same gym, commented that he wondered if Tomori could sustain himself for three rounds. Nevertheless, he built a lead over Ursúa until the middle of the fight throwing his sharp right crosses and left jabs. In the later rounds Ursúa fought back fiercely, but was dethroned via a split decision. Ursúa expressed dissatisfaction to the decision. His first defense against Hilario Zapata was initially scheduled in Panama City on June 5, 1982. However it was postponed to July 20 and moved to the Ishikawa Sangyō Hall in Kanazawa, Ishikawa due to Tomori's rib injury. In that first defense, Tomori lost to Zapata via a split decision. Misako protested the decision of the judges to the WBC, and Tomori had a rematch with Zapata as a challenger at the Kuramae Kokugikan on November 30 of the same year. However Tomori who had believed his own victory in the previous fight, told that he would not be able to fight more than he did on July 20. He suffered a cut above his left eye from the sixth round, and was stopped in the eighth round after being floored in the seventh and eighth rounds. Some time after that fight, Tomori hung up his gloves.

Indeed, during the Second World War, he worked as a journalist for the Nazi newspaper Fædrelandet. Bunnén had extensive interests in culture. He developed a new technique called Dansk Fresko (Danish fresco) based on the use of casein paint on cement.

He was among the members of the Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees. Kosta graduated from the Bulgarian school in Radovish in 1895 and then the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki. In 1899 he began to study in the Sofia University. Later he married the sister of the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) leader Todor Alexandrov and graduated in chemistry in Geneve. Afterwards Tsipushev returned to Radovish and worked there as a teacher, continuing his participation in the activity of IMARO. He was arrested several times by the Ottoman authorities and imprisoned for two years. At that time he worked subsequently as with Gotse Delchev, Dame Gruev, Boris Sarafov and Todor Alexandrov.

At the end of the war Tsipushev was captured by the English troops in the area and delivered to the Serbian authorities as war criminal.

After his liberation in 1938 he went back to Bulgaria. During Bulgarian annexation of Vardar Banovina between 1941 - 1944 he returned to Macedonia again. However, after 1944 Communist Bulgaria and Communist Yugoslavia began a policy of making Macedonia connecting link for the establishment of new Balkan Federative Republic and stimulating here a development of distinct Slav Macedonian consciousness. Tsipushev was expelled from Yugoslavia to Bulgaria, but as a concession to the Yugoslavian side, Bulgarian communist authorities agreed also with the recognition of a distinct Macedonian ethnicity as part of the population in the Bulgarian Macedonia. They made an attempt to gain Tsipushev on their side as collaborationist, but he refused. Because he openly opposed the official policy of macedonization, he was repressed and exiled to the interior of Bulgaria. His memoirs called 19 years in Serbian prisons issued in 1943 were banned and obliterated from the communists. At the end of the 1950s the Bulgarian Communist Party, however repealed its previous decision and adopted a position denying the existence of a “Macedonian” nation. Afterwards Tsipushev was partially rehabilitated. He died in Sofia in 1968. With the fall of Communism his book was issued in Republic of Macedonia in 2003 and reissued in Bulgaria in 2006.

She is included in the Year 24 Group. She resides in Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture. The year 24 group was a group of female authors in the early 1970s who helped change shoujo manga from being created by male authors to being created by female authors. As part of this group, Takemiya pioneered a genre of girls' comics about love between young men; in December 1970 she published a short story, "In the Sunroom", in Bessatsu Shōjo Komikku, which is possibly the first shōnen-ai manga published and contains the earliest known male-male kiss in shōjo manga. Takemiya cites her influences as being shonen manga, the work of Shotaro Ishinomori, films, and documentaries. In 1972, after publishing Sora ga Suki!, Takemiya travelled to Europe so that she could find out more about life there as research for Kaze to Ki no Uta. After that, she travelled to different parts of Europe on an almost annual basis. Among her most noted works are the manga Toward the Terra and Kaze to Ki no Uta, which are noted for being pioneering series of the 1970s and 1980s. She received the 1979 Shogakukan Manga Award for shōjo manga and shōnen manga respectively for Kaze to Ki no Uta and Terra e..., and the prestigious Seiun Award for science fiction manga in 1978 for Terra e.... She is regarded as "one of the first successful crossover women artists" to create both shōjo and shōnen manga. Many of her series have been adapted into anime, including Terra e... in 1980 and 2007, Natsu e no Tobira in 1981, and Kaze to Ki no Uta in 1987. In 1983, she served as special designer to the Sunrise theatrical film Crusher Joe: The Movie, alongside other noted manga artists Yumiko Igarashi, Fujihiko Hosono, Rumiko Takahashi, Hideo Azuma, Hisaichi Ishii, Katsuhiro Otomo, Miki Tori, Shinji Wada and Akira Toriyama.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ehsan_Tabari	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sari,_Iran	Ehsan Tabari (1917–1989) was an Iranian intellectual, a founding member and theoretician of the Pro-Soviet Tudeh party. Tabari was born in 1917 in Sari, Mazandaran, Iran. Tabari was fluent in eight languages, he wrote and translated poetry and did research in linguistics. He returned to Iran in 1979 after the overthrow of the Shah, but was arrested in 1983 along with other leaders of the Tudeh Party. In May 1984 he confessed on television for spying for the USSR and other crimes. In what one called the "finale of the Tudeh recantations", Tabari proclaimed to television viewers that he converted from Marxism to Islam and had come to realize his entire life's work was `defective`, damaging`, and `totally spurious.` Having read "great Islamic thinkers" such as Ayatollah Motahhari in prison he realized his ideas were based on Freemasons, secularists, western liberals and Marxists linked to `imperialism` and `Zionism`. Disbelief about the sincerity of the Tabari's conversion has been fed by the fact that after giving a confessional speech to other political prisoners at Evin prison he was asked by the prison warden "to deny outright the rumour that he had cast himself into the role of a `Galileo,`" Tabari gave not a clear denial but a "long convoluted response;" and that after his confession he remained "not only incarcerated but also total isolation - even from his own family". Tabari died on April 29, 1989 of kidney and heart failure, under house arrest.

He rose to popularity in 2004 with his character "The Guitar Zamurai (Samurai)" (ギター侍) on the program The God of Entertainment (エンタの神様). Dressed in a yukata, his skit always follows the same form. He says a supposed quote about someone famous, and then mocks the quote (and the person) and says "残念!" (zannen!, Too Bad!) Then he imitates the person and finishes that section with a "切り" (giri!, Slash!) as he makes a sword slash movement with his guitar. At the end of a set, he usually says some self-depreciating remark and ends yelling "切腹!" (seppuku!). His popularity in this persona earned him an animated cameo in the Crayon Shin-Chan movie, "Crayon Shin-chan: The Legend of the Buri Buri 3 Minutes Charge" in which he played a monster that made fun of the sliding timescale of the cartoon (and thereby breaking the Fourth Wall). After the novelty wore thin on the gimmick, he began to intermittently make appearances on variety shows under the Yoku Hata pseudonym and in regular street clothes. He has recently begun to bring back the "Guitar Zamurai" character sporadically, to play on its nostalgic appeal. In 2008, he formed a clique of other one hit wonder comedians on the quiz/variety show, Quiz! Hexagon II called "Ippatsuya 2008" (一発屋２００８).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Koide_Chōjūrō	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokushima,_Tokushima	Koide Chōjūrō (小出 長十郎, October 16, 1797 – October 6, 1865), also known as Koide Shuke, was a Japanese mathematician in the Edo period. Koide was a student of Wada Nei. Students of Koide included Fukuda Riken, who is also known as Fukuda Sen. The first extensive logarithmic table was published in 1844 by Koide Shuki. This was twenty years after the death of Sakabe Kōhan, whose Sampo Tenzan Shinan-roku (Treatise on Tenzan Algebra) in 1810 proposed the use of logarithmic tables. Sakebe explained that "these tables save much labor, [but] they are but little known for the reason that they have never been printed in our country." This can be explained by the conventional thinking of the period. For example, Koide exhibited a fixed point-of-view in his preface to Tan-i sampō in 1840, explaining: "Number dwells in the heavens and in the earth, but the arts are of human make, some being accurate and others not. The minuteness of our mathematical work far surpasses that to be found in the West, because our power is a divine inheritance, fostered by the noble and daring spirit of a nation that is exalted over the other nations of the world." During the Tenpō era, Koide translated portions of Jérôme Lalande's work on astronomy. He presented this work to the Astronomy Board as evidence of the superiority of the European calendar, but the effort produced no identifiable effect. However, Koide's work and translations of other Western writers did indirectly affect the Tenpo calendar revision in 1842–1844. Koide was part of the team of astronomers and mathematicians working on an improved lunar calendar system. A great many errors had been found in the lunar calendar; and revisions were publicly adopted in 1844. The new calendar was called the Tenpō-Jinin calendar. It was in use in Japan until 1872 when the Gregorian calendar was adopted.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graciela_Ocaña	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/San_Justo,_Buenos_Aires	Ocaña was born and raised in the western Buenos Aires suburb of San Justo in 1960. Raised without her father, she lost her mother to an accident at age five and was taken in by her maternal grandparents, both immigrants from Spain. Ocaña received her primary education at the Santa Rosa de Lima School, an institution maintained by Dominican nuns. She was transferred to the San Justo Secondary School system and enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires in 1978, where she graduated with a degree in Political Science in 1983. Ocaña became affiliated with the Justicialist Party and found work in the private sector, managing a number of import-export businesses in the San Justo area. Ocaña became disaffected from the Justicialist Party following President Carlos Menem's unexpected adoption of free market policies after taking office and, in 1993, she aligned herself with the eight congressmen who had left the party to form the center-left Frente Grande. An adviser to Buenos Aires Province Congressman "Chacho" Álvarez (the party's leader), she was elected to the Argentine Lower House of Congress as a member of the Frente Grande's successor, FrePaSo, on the Alliance ticket that brought Álvarez to the office of Vice President in 1999. Ocaña earned renown for her work in the Money Laundering and Capital flight Subcommitee in Congress, where in 2001 she led investigations into businessman Emir Yoma and Córdoba Province Vice Governor Germán Kammerath, among others. President Fernando de la Rúa's resignation in December and the attendant crisis dissolved the Alliance, whereby Ocaña joined fellow Congresswoman Elisa Carrió's ARI, a new center-left christian democratic party. Enjoying Carrió's esteem, she was invited to run on the ARI ticket for Governor of Buenos Aires Province, but declined, opting to stand for reelection as Congresswoman. Prominent in the Small Business Committee, in January 2004 President Néstor Kirchner appointed her Director of the National Integrated Medical Attention Plan (PAMI), a national health insurance program hitherto struggling under chronic mismanagement. Known for her differences with her boss at the time, Health Minister Ginés González García, over abortion rights and birth control (which she opposed), she maintained a low profile while earning plaudits for her active intervention in a number of large public hospitals, notably the Hospital Francés. Increasingly distanced from ARI leader Elisa Carrió, Ocaña formally resigned her seat in Congress in 2006. Hoping to win a fraction of ARI voters over following their defeat in the October 2007 elections, President-elect Cristina Kirchner offered Ocaña the post of Health and Environment Minister, which the popular PAMI director accepted, taking office on December 10. Ocaña's decision to demand reimbursement for around US$60 million in PAMI services rendered to health plans administered by the CGT and other labor unions intensified CGT Secretary General Hugo Moyano's opposition to her tenure, helping result in her June 23, 2009, decision to resign her post. Her departure from the Health Ministry was not announced until after the mid-term elections on June 28, and Tucumán Province surgeon and Vice Governor Juan Luis Manzur was tapped to succeed her on July 1.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Masatoshi_Shima	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shizuoka,_Shizuoka	Masatoshi Shima (嶋 正利 Shima Masatoshi, born August 22, 1943, Shizuoka) is a Japanese electronics engineer, who was one of the designers of the world's first microprocessor, the Intel 4004, along with Federico Faggin, Ted Hoff, and Stanley Mazor. He studied organic chemistry at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan. With poor prospects for employment in the field of chemistry, he went to work for Busicom, a business calculator manufacturer. There, he learned about software and digital logic design. When Busicom decided to use large-scale integration circuits in their calculator products, they approached the American companies Mostek and Intel for manufacturing help. The job was given to Intel, who back then was more of a memory company and had facilities to manufacture the high density silicon gate MOS chip Busicom required.Following Marcian "Ted" Hoff's initial conception, formulated in 1969, Shima later helped design the 4004 processor, working at the Intel offices for six months- from April until October 1970- with Federico Faggin, the project leader. His company then sold the rights to use the 4004 to Intel, with the exception of use in business calculators. Intel then designed the 8008 (architecture by Computer Terminal Corporation, design by Federico Faggin and Hal Feeney). Shima was then employed to implement the transistor-level logic of Intel's next microprocessor, which became the Intel 8080 (conception and architecture by Federico Faggin), he was not involved in creation of 8088 and 8086. Shima moved to Zilog in 1975 and, using only a small number of assistants, developed the transistor-level and physical implementation of the Z80, under the supervision of Faggin, who conceived and designed the Z80 architecture to be instruction set compatible with the Intel 8080. This was followed by the same task for the 16-bit Z8000. According to co-workers from Intel, Faggin's method that Shima used was to design all logic at the transistor level directly and manually (not at the gate and/or register level). The schematics were therefore hard to read, but as transistors were drawn in such a way that they suggested a "floorplan" of the chip, it actually helped when making the physical chip layout. However, according to Shima himself, the logic was first tested on breadboards using TTL chips, before being manually translated into MOS transistor equivalents.

He was the youngest of seven senior monks re-ordained under Vietnamese supervision in 1979 in order to provide a core leadership group for the re-establishment of the Cambodian sangha, which had been nearly destroyed by the Khmer Rouge. In 1979, Tep Vong gave evidence at the trial in absentia of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, testifying that Pol Pot had personally executed 57 monks, including several family members. He also claimed to have personally been sentenced to four years labor by the Khmer Rouge. Following the trial, he was elected President of the Unified Cambodian Buddhist Sangha. While President of the Unified Sangha, Tep Vong put forth the argument that certain forms of political violence could be condoned by Buddhism. In 1981, Tep Vong was appointed the sangharaja of a unified Cambodian Sangha, temporarily dissolving the division between the Dhammayuttika and Mahanikaya orders that had existed since 1855. He remained the sole official sangharaja of Cambodia until 1991, when Venerable Bour Kry was appointed sangharaja of the Dhammayuttika Nikaya by King Sihanouk. Venerable Tep Vong has been previously criticized by younger members of the sangha for his ties to the government of Vietnam, and with members of the CPP (Cambodian People's Party) government. He has come into conflict with younger members of the sangha who have voiced opposition to government policies and corruption, on one occasion calling publicly for the arrest of the organizers of an anti-government protest. In 2006, Tep Vong was elevated to the title of Samdech Preah Agga Mahā Sangharājādhipati (Khmer: សម្តេច ព្រះ អគ្គមហាសង្ឃរាជាធិបតី), or Great Supreme Patriarch. He is the first monk in over 150 years to receive this title.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Édouard_Richard	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Princeville,_Quebec	Édouard-Émery Richard (March 14, 1844 – March 27, 1904) was a Canadian historian and politician. Richard was born in Princeville, Quebec to Louis-Eusèbe Richard and Hermine Prince. After receiving his law degree in 1867, taking courses at both Université Laval and McGill College, Richard began to practice in Arthabaskaville with Wilfrid Laurier. He practiced for several years before being elected to the House of Commons from Mégantic in 1872 and was re-elected in 1874. His health forced him to not seek reelection in the 1878 Canadian Parliamentary elections. Politically, Richard was a liberal protectionist. Richard became the sheriff of the Northwest Territories soon after leaving the House of Commons, and remained in that position until January 1883. After resigning from his post as sheriff, he sought election to the House of Commons again in 1883 in St. Boniface, but was defeated by Alphonse Alfred Clément Larivière. Richard sought election once more, in 1889 in Provencher, but Lariviére again defeated him. In between his political posts, Richard was also a fairly successful businessman. Unfortunately, his political campaigns and frequent ill health prevented him from ever amassing substantial wealth. Richard was of Acadian heritage. Following his last failed campaign, Richard returned to Arthabaskaville and began to immerse himself in his heritage. He fervently promoted the Acadian cause, petitioning for an Acadian museum, working on his own research, and even starting a campaign for reparations. An 1893 article in Toronto by Pierce Stevens Hamilton and histories by Francis Parkman and Thomas Beamish Akins spurred Richard to begin his own published history. His work, Acadia, Missing Links of a Lost Chapter in American History, was published in two volumes in 1895. His work was controversial, both for mixing English and French in text and, more significantly, lacking annotations and citations. His book was republished with annotations added by his cousin, Henri d'Arles, from 1916 to 1921. Despite this controversy, his work brought him accolades, including an election to the Royal Society of Canada and an honorary doctorate from Université Laval. In 1897, Richard, who never married, was named the successor to Joseph Marmette as the official Canadian archivist in France. This was his last main work before his death in Willow Bunch, Saskatchewan in 1904.

Born to a noble father and mother in Sawahlunto, West Sumatra, after finishing his primary education, he went to Batavia (modern day Jakarta) to study medicine; in the city's slums, he saw much poverty, which became an academic interest later in life. After being expelled from medical school by the Japanese in 1943 for his political activities, Soedjatmoko moved to Surakarta and practised medicine with his father. In 1947, after Indonesia proclaimed its independence, Soedjatmoko and two other youths were deployed to Lake Success, New York, to represent Indonesia at the United Nations (UN). They helped secure international recognition of the country's sovereignty. After his work at the UN, Soedjatmoko attempted to study at Harvard's Littauer Center for Public Administration (now the John F. Kennedy School of Government); however, he was forced to resign due to pressure from other work, including serving as Indonesia's first chargé d'affaires in London for three months as well as establishing the political desk at the Embassy of Indonesia in Washington, D.C. By 1952 he had returned to Indonesia, where he became involved in the socialist press and joined the Socialist Party of Indonesia. He was elected as a member of the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia in 1955, serving until 1959; he married Ratmini Gandasubrata in 1958. However, as President Sukarno's government became more authoritarian Soedjatmoko began to criticise the government. To avoid censorship, he spent two years as a guest lecturer at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and another three in self-imposed unemployment in Indonesia. After Sukarno was replaced by Suharto, Soedjatmoko returned to public service. In 1966 he was sent as one of Indonesia's representatives at the UN, and in 1968 he became Indonesia's ambassador to the US; during this time he received several honorary doctoral degrees. He also advised foreign minister Adam Malik. After returning to Indonesia in 1971, Soedjatmoko held a position in several think tanks. After the Malari incident in January 1974, Soedjatmoko was held for interrogation for two and a half weeks and accused of masterminding the event. Although eventually released, he could not leave Indonesia for two and a half years. In 1978 Soedjatmoko received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding, and in 1980 he was chosen as rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo. Two years after returning from Japan, Soedjatmoko died of cardiac arrest while teaching in Yogyakarta.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude-Henri_Grignon	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sainte-Adèle,_Quebec	Claude-Henri Grignon (July 8, 1894 – April 3, 1976) was a Canadian novelist, journalist and politician, most famous for his novel Un Homme et son péché. Born in Sainte-Adèle, Quebec, he was a cousin of writer Germaine Guèvremont. He began working as a journalist in 1916, writing for a number of publications in Quebec, including La Minerve, Le Matin, Le Canada, Le Petit Journal, La Revue populaire, La Renaissance and Bataille. He published his debut novel, Le Secret de Lindbergh, in 1929, and followed up with Un Homme et son péché in 1933 and the short story collection Le Déserteur et autres récits de la terre in 1934. As well, he was a prominent literary and political critic, whose non-fiction works included Les Vivants et les autres, Ombres et Clameurs and Les Pamphlets de Valdombre, a trenchant satire of the government of Maurice Duplessis. By satirizing rather than glorifying life in rural Quebec, Un Homme et son péché broke with Quebec's literary conventions of its time, and came to be recognized as one of Quebec's first influential modernist novels. Ironically, his cousin Germaine's novels Le Survenant and Marie-Didace are considered to be the last influential examples of Quebec's more traditionalist romans du terroir. Les Pamphlets de Valdombre also first advanced the theory that publisher and literary critic Louis Dantin was the real author of the poetry of Émile Nelligan; although the claim was widely derided and denied by Dantin himself, it was later readvanced by literary historian Yvette Francoli in her 2013 book Le naufragé du Vaisseau d’or. He subsequently wrote a radio dramatization of Un Homme et son péché, as well as the television adaptation Les Belles Histoires des pays d'en haut. The novel has also been adapted as a film three times, including 2002's Séraphin: Heart of Stone. Grignon later served as mayor of Sainte-Adèle from 1941 to 1951.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yui_Shōsetsu	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shizuoka,_Shizuoka	Yui Shōsetsu (由井正雪 1605 – September 10, 1651) was a military strategist, and leader of the unsuccessful 1651 Keian Uprising. Though a commoner, and thus not officially of the samurai class, Yui was known as one of the "Three Great Ronin" along with Kumazawa Banzan and Yamaga Sokō. Born in Sunpu to humble origins, Yui is said to have been a talented youth; he was taken in by a number of rōnin from the area, who taught him recent history, and likely swordsmanship and military strategy as well. As an adult, he found employment as an instructor at a samurai academy, teaching swordsmanship and related disciplines. But these academies, which could be found throughout the country, served not only the pure function of schools of martial arts; certainly, discipline, ethics, and related arts were taught as well. But the schools also served as social and intellectual spaces, in which political ideas were discussed, and grievances aired in a familiar environment where comrades and friends met. Students were almost exclusively members of the samurai class, but running the full gamut of rankings, from daimyo to ronin. As regulations were made stricter at this time, and many ronin expelled from their domains, the number of students grew dramatically. He later opened a school of military strategy and martial arts in the Renjaku-chō neighborhood of Kanda in Edo, as well as an armorer's shop and ironworks. Here he continued to gain contacts, friends, and prestige among the ronin and others; one of them was Marubashi Chūya, a samurai and fellow instructor of martial disciplines and strategy, with whom he would plan the Keian Uprising some years later. Beginning in 1645, Yui plotted a coup against the Tokugawa shogunate along with Marubashi, a small group of rōnin, and a number of their students. It was to take place in 1651, shortly after the death of Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu, and would later come to be known as the Keian Uprising. Unfortunately for Yui and his comrades, the plot was discovered before it truly began. Yui was in Sunpu, preparing to execute a secondary series of attacks when Marubashi was arrested in Edo; surrounded by shogunate officials, he committed seppuku rather than be captured. Following his death, the officials performed a variety of obscenities upon his body, and then proceeded to subject his parents and other close relatives to crucifixion. Yui Shōsetsu, though ultimately unsuccessful in his political plots, is a notable figure as representative of the growing political unrest in the early Edo period, as a result of strict laws put forth, and enforced, by the shogunate. He and his conspirators were only one of many groups throughout the country meeting in samurai academies and other venues, discussing politics and current events. Most, of course, did not act upon their beliefs as Yui and Marubashi did, but that discussion existed among a great number of people, despite, or perhaps because of the shogunate's strict enforcement of its laws, is significant.

He sits in the Argentine Senate representing Tierra del Fuego Province in the majority block of the Front for Victory and was formerly governor of that province. Colazo attended primary school in Córdoba before moving to Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego for his secondary education. He was involved in various community organisations. During the Falklands War he served in civil protection in Río Grande. From an early age, Colazo was involved in the UCR and held senior positions in the party at provincial and national levels. From 1989 to 1991 he served as a Río Grande councillor and in 1991 he was elected Mayor of Río Grande, serving until 1999. In that year he stood as candidate for governor of the Province. From January 2000 he worked as Head of the Social Services for Pensioners for the Province until 2001. In 2001 Colazo was elected as Senator. Then in 2003 he was elected as governor of the province, defeating incumbent Peronist Carlos Manfredotti and taking office in January 2004 with Hugo Cóccaro as his vice-governor. Although a Radical, he was by now identified with the attempt at political consensus of the new President, Peronist Néstor Kirchner, and was seen as one of the leading 'Radicales K'. Indeed Cóccaro was a Justicialist, although he had been a supporter of the anti-Kirchner Peronist leader Adolfo Rodríguez Saá against Kirchner for the Presidency. The relationship between Colazo and Cóccaro soon deteriorated, to the extent that Colazo even accused his deputy of involvement in plans to assassinate him. Colazo had also been isolated from his party, who had suspended him for his links with the Peronists. He was put under investigation by the provincial legislature for misuse of municipal funds in Río Grande and for bypassing the legislature when making budget decisions in 2004, and in September 2005 he was suspended as governor. He was impeached in December 2005 and Cóccaro formally took over. In 2007 Colazo stood for and was re-elected to the Senate, heading the Federalist Union list. He sits with the Kirchners' Front for Victory. However in March 2008, a Tierra del Fuego court requested that the Senate expel him in connection with the ongoing allegations relating to improper use of funds while Mayor of Río Grande. This would allow Colazo to be prosecuted.

As architectural critic Thomas Daniell put it, "A key figure who explicitly rejected Western influences yet appears on almost every branch of the family tree of contemporary Japanese architecture... is Kazuo Shinohara... His effects on the discipline as a theorist, designer and teacher have been immense." He studied at Tokyo Institute of Technology, (TIT) finishing in 1953, and going on to become professor in 1970. He established his own practice in 1954, going on to design more than 30 residential buildings, as well as many key public buildings across Japan. His work is generally classified as having strong qualities of lucidity and ephemerality, and for these reasons is often seen as ideologically influential on Toyo Ito's work. He was awarded the Architectural Institute of Japan's (AIJ) grand prize in 2005. In 2010 the Biennale di Venezia awarded a special commemorative Golden Lion in memory of Kazuo Shinohara.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haruhiko_Kuroda	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ōmuta,_Fukuoka	Haruhiko Kuroda (黒田 東彦 Kuroda Haruhiko, born 25 October 1944), is the 31st and current Governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ). He was formerly the President of the Asian Development Bank from 1 February 2005 to 18 March 2013. Kuroda has been an advocate of looser monetary policy in Japan. His February 2013 nomination by the incoming government of the Prime Minister Shinzō Abe had been expected. Also nominated at the same time were Kikuo Iwata — "a harsh critic of past BOJ policies" — and Hiroshi Nakaso, a senior BOJ official in charge of international affairs, as Kuroda's two deputies. The former governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, left in March 2013. "There is plenty of room for monetary easing" in Japan, Kuroda said in a February 2013 interview, adding that the BOJ could go beyond purchasing government bonds to include corporate bonds "or even stocks". The yen, which "has fallen 10% against the dollar since Abe began his campaign in November", also fell on the news of Kuroda's nomination. However, the new governor is "expected to use his experience as Japan’s top currency official until 2003 to rebut overseas criticism that Tokyo is using easy monetary policy to drive the yen lower, triggering a war of competitive currency devaluation". Bloomberg quoted Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University, as saying about Kuroda's goals: “It’s a strong pledge from a well-intended man, but I’m not convinced it’s going to work." When Kuroda was asked the same question in his assumption of office's press conference on March 21, Kuroda said the BOJ's role is to stabilize prices, and stabilizing exchange rates is the role of the Ministry of Finance. He also said that BOJ's "Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing" policy does not intend to devalue, aiming to grow out of deflation by targeting inflation. Although there was opposition from developing countries, the policy was accepted by the other developed countries in the G20 summit. However, G20 members emphasized to Japanese policymakers that it must be used domestically while highlighting the importance of a Japanese effort to reduce government debt. In early 2016 after a stretch of global market weakness, Kuroda led Japan's move into negative interest rates. The BOJ had already pushed its balance sheet from 35% to 70+% of GDP since 2013 and was continuing to buy ¥80 trillion (over $600 billion) of securities each month. “Risks were growing that the slowdown in the Chinese, emerging and resource-producing countries, which has caused volatility and instability in financial markets since the beginning of the year, may hurt confidence among domestic [Japanese] companies,” Kuroda was quoted as saying at the time of the interest-rate cut.

His natural father's family name was Nakamura, but Kyusaku was adopted by the Ogino family in 1901. Ogino studied infertility and developed a method to estimate the fertile period of the menstrual cycle based on the length of a woman's past cycles. This knowledge could be used by couples seeking pregnancy to time intercourse so as to maximize the chances of conception. In 1930, John Smulders, Roman Catholic physician from the Netherlands, used this discovery to create a method for avoiding pregnancy. Smulders published his work with the Dutch Roman Catholic medical association, and this was the official Rhythm Method promoted over the next several decades. Ogino opposed the use of his method for contraception. He argued that its failure rate was too high: to promote it for contraception, despite the availability of other effective contraceptive methods, would result in many abortions from unwanted pregnancies. Despite this, the Rhythm Method of contraception is ironically referred to as the Ogino Method (オギノ式 ogino-shiki) in Japan. Babies born to parents using this method are known in France as "bébés Ogino."

He wrote the Kutadgu Bilig and most of what is known about him comes from his own writings in this work. Balasagun was located at the Burana archaeological site near the present-day city of Tokmok in Northern Kyrgyzstan. Yusuf Khas Hajib was about 50 years old when he completed the Kutadgu Bilig. After presenting the completed work to the prince of Kashgar he was awarded the title Khāṣṣ Ḥājib, an honorific similar to "Privy Chamberlain" or "Chancellor". He is also referred to as Yūsuf Balasaguni. Some scholars suspect that the prologue to the Kutadgu Bilig, which is much more overtly Islamic than the rest of the text, was not written by Yūsuf, particularly the first prologue, which is in prose, unlike the rest of the text. Some authors believed that Yusuf Khas Hajib died in 1085 at the age of 66 in the city of Kashgar, and was buried there. There is now a mausoleum erected on his alleged gravesite. However, there is no source about his death date and place. and the modern museum was erected in the 1980s for purely touristic reasons.

He is the son of artist Lalit Soni, and the grandson of Prabhu Lal Soni, who was once court photographer to the Maharana Sir Bhopal Singh of Mewar. Prabhu Lal Soni (also known as Prabhu Lal Verma) was not only a court photographer, but also a hand-colorist who painted the black-and-white photographs that he produced. The skills of hand-coloring photographs were passed down to Rajesh through the intermediary of his father Lalit. Rajesh Soni’s talents for sketching and drawing were noticed at an early age and fostered by his father. As a young boy, Rajesh sketched from life the historic havelis and architecture of Udaipur’s old city, sometimes looking over the shoulders of art students who gathered to sketch on the ghats, and also eagerly teaching himself English from visiting tourists. In 2007 Rajesh met the American photographer Waswo X. Waswo, who encouraged him to work on reviving the tradition of hand-colored photography. Working on Waswo’s digital prints, Soni blended his grandfather’s traditional craft with the new technologies of photographic printing. This collaborative effort between Soni and Waswo, combined with a series of collaborative miniatures Waswo had done in conjunction with the painter Rakesh Vijay, was eventually to become an exhibition that toured India under the name A Studio in Rajasthan. Since the success of these exhibitions Soni has travelled to Italy, Switzerland, and beyond. A portion of these photographic collaborations between Rajesh Soni and Waswo X. Waswo was released as the book Men of Rajasthan, published by Serindia Contemporary in 2011.

Melnikaitė was born to a family of a Russian mother and a Lithuanian father. She had four other siblings and the parents took assorted jobs to provide for the large family. Melnikaitė started working at Avanti confectionery at age 14 and studied sewing. In 1940, after Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union, Melnikaitė joined Komsomol and started evening classes. Reportedly her father did not approve her Komsomol activities, which included her singing in a choir. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Melnikaitė along with other Komsomol members was evacuated to Russia where she took a job at a machine tool plant in Tyumen. In July 1942, she joined the Soviet Army (16th Rifle Division) and was sent to a saboteur school in Balakhna. In May 1943, she finished the studies and was sent to Belarus and then back to her native Zarasai where she joined the Soviet partisan group Kęstutis under the name of Ona Kuosaitė. Melnikaitė's partisan life lasted less than two months. In July 1943, she and several other partisans were sent on a mission to bring more weapons from Soviet partisans operating in Belarus. Local inhabitants spotted the group near Apvardai Lake in Ignalina district and called Lithuanian policemen. During a shootout, several partisans were killed, while Melnikaitė was captured. Her custody was transferred to the German police. After five days of torture she was shot in the cemetery of Kaniūkai village. The death of the twenty-year-old was used by Soviet propaganda, which exaggerated her duties, accomplishments, and circumstances of her death. For example, in March 1944, Antanas Sniečkus wrote in Tiesa that the shootout lasted a day and that Melnikaitė personally killed seven policemen, was badly injured, attempted to commit suicide with a grenade, and even after brutal torture did not betray her fellow partisans.

They had two daughters, Zinaida Volkova (1901-1933) and Nina Nevelson (1902-1928).

After Trotsky met Natalia Sedova, his future second wife, in Paris in late 1902, his first marriage disintegrated, although the two maintained a friendly relationship until the end. Not much is known about Sokolovskaya's life post-1902. Her daughters were mostly raised by David and Anna Bronstein, Trotsky's wealthy parents, in Yanovka, Ukraine.

According to the family, Sokolovskaya was an educator and was close to Lenin's widow, Nadezhda Krupskaya, in the early 1930s. Sokolovskaya was arrested and exiled in 1935.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gustav_Pietsch	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ueckermünde	Gustav Pietsch (1893 – 1975) was a German captain, resistance fighter and Politician of the Free City of Danzig. Pietsch was born in Bellin, Pomerania and served in the German Navy in World War I on a minesweeper and U-boat escort. He received his master’s certificate and served in 1919/20 at the harbour of Danzig (today Gdańsk). In 1918 he married Gertrude née Behnke from Glettkau (today Jelitkowo), where they settled. Glettkau lay on the soil of the Free City of Danzig and throughout the 1920s Pietsch worked as a captain on several cargo and fishing boats. He was a member of the German Merchant Navy Officer’s Association and the Association of Combat Veterans, closely affiliated to the German National People's Party (DNVP). His wife was active in the female section of the Combat Veteran’s Association. In 1932 the Officer’s Association en bloc joined the Nazi Party, which was opposed by Pietsch, who left the Association. In early 1933 the Nazis joined the government of the Free City and issued several anti-semitic laws. Jews were dismissed from all public offices and the Combat Veterans were urged to do the same. In this situation Pietsch became the Chairman of the Danzig branch of the Association and vehemently opposed any discrimination of JewishVeterans, which caused his first arrest. In 1935 he organized 150 non-Jewish Veterans to join a commemoration in the Synagogue of Danzig to protect the service against Nazi-attacks. His actions led to a boycott of his business and in 1933 his wife opened a pastry shop in Oliva to secure the family’s maintenance. The shop was however also boycotted and besmeared with anti-semitic slogans. In 1935 the City’s administration revoked the concession without further reasoning. Pietsch himself meanwhile worked as an instructor at the nautical and fishery school “Godonia Mapilim” of the zionist association “Zewulon” in Gdynia. He instructed several hundred Jews from Poland and Danzig and organized the emigration of about 400 Jews to Palestine. In 1935 he founded a weekly newspaper “Feldgrauer Alarm” (Fieldgrey Alarm) and ran for the Volkstag elections as an independent candidate (list “Freie Frontkämpfer”), associated to the “Liste Weise” of former DNVP members. Pietsch was attacked several times by the Nazis and severely injured when he was pushed in front of a tramway. On 12 June 1936 the local Nazi-SA stormed the general meeting of the DNVP while Pietsch held a speech, 60 persons were injured and Pietsch was again arrested. While the SA men were soon released, Pietsch was kept in prison for several weeks. On 24 December 1938 Pietsch managed to leave Danzig and, supported by the Jewish Agency, emigrated to Palestine. He arrived on 10 January 1939 and founded the village of Neve Yam, where he continued to work as a nautical and fishery instructor. At the outbreak of World War II Pietsch was arrested by the British as an “enemy alien” but released again in February 1940. In 1952 Pietsch became captain of the port of Eilat. In 1958 he returned to Germany and was honoured in 1961 by the Senate of Berlin as "Unbesungener Held" (unsung hero). Pietsch emigrated to Australia, where his daughter lived on a farm she had named "Glettkau", and died in 1975.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rakesh_Vijay	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Udaipur	Rakesh Vijay (22 March 1970), professionally known as R. Vijay, is a Rajasthani miniaturist best known for his collaborative work with American artist Waswo X. Waswo. R. Vijay received little formal training and his miniature painting style has been described as naïve, though his works have drawn attention and praise from various critics throughout India. Early in life Rakesh was tutored by traditional miniaturists such as Sukhdev Singh Sisodiya and Laxmi Narayan Sikaligar. Later he developed his own style, which has been called an eclectic mix of Persian and Mogul styles, along with a bit of the Company School of Indo-British art. The artist also takes inspiration from his great-uncle Ram Gopal Vijayvargia, a well-known Rajasthani miniaturist who had practiced his art in Jaipur, and became widely acclaimed in India not only for his paintings but also for his many short stories published in Hindi. In 2004 R.Vijay began doing collaborative work with the American Waswo X. Waswo. Taking concepts suggested by Waswo, Vijay creates a series of miniatures that depict a foreigner’s life in India, complete with a wide variety of emotions and predicaments. In this collaborative work the two artists pull together an extremely disparate collection of cultural references, from both the East and the West. The two artists take joint credit for this body of work, with R. Vijay signing each painting and Waswo embossing his initials. This work has been exhibited along with the collaborations Waswo has done with photographic hand-colorist Rajesh Soni under the exhibition title “A Studio in Rajasthan”.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franciszek_Żwirko	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Švenčionys	Franciszek Żwirko (16 September 1895 – 11 September 1932) was a prominent Polish sport and military aviator. Along with Stanisław Wigura, he won the international air contest Challenge 1932. He was born in Święciany, near Wilno currently in Lithuania (at that time part of the Russian Empire) and attended school in Wilno. During World War I, he volunteered for the Russian Army, graduated from an officer school in Irkutsk, and served in infantry, fighting against the Germans. He was awarded with the Order of St. Anna, 4th class. In 1917 he joined the Polish corps of Gen. Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki, formed in Russia. After the corps was disbanded in 1918, he enlisted in Gen. Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army and fought against the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War. He completed an air observer course then. After the Bolsheviks' victory in the war in 1921, Żwirko fought his way to Poland across the Soviet-Polish border. In Poland, he completed an aviation school in Bydgoszcz in November 1923, and a higher pilotage school in Grudziądz. He became a fighter pilot in the 18th Fighter Squadron of the 1st Air Regiment, with a rank of porucznik pilot (flying lieutenant). He also became active in sports aviation. Żwirko distinguished himself as a very skilled and calm pilot. In August 1927, flying a Breguet 19 military plane, he took the 2nd place in the 1st air contest of the Little Entente and Poland in Yugoslavia, and the 1st place in its rally part. From 1929 he was assigned as a liaison officer in the University Aeroclub (Aeroklub Akademicki) in Warsaw. Thanks to his new post, he could increase his sporting activity, meeting young aviation enthusiasts - mostly students of Warsaw University of Technology. He especially made friends with young engineer Stanislaw Wigura, one of designers of the RWD team. They often flew together from then, Wigura as a mechanic and second pilot. Between 9 August and 6 September 1929, Żwirko and Wigura flew the RWD-2 prototype across Europe, on Warsaw–Paris–Barcelona–Milano–Warsaw 5000 km route, and on October 6 they won in the 1st Rally of South-Eastern Poland. On October 16, 1929, Żwirko and Antoni Kocjan set an international FAI altitude record of 4,004 m (13,136 ft) in the light tourist plane class (below 280 kg or 616 lb empty weight) on that plane. In July 1930 Żwirko and Wigura took part in the International Tourist Plane Competition Challenge 1930, flying the RWD-4, but they had to withdraw on July 25 due to engine failure, after an emergency landing in Spain. In September and October 1930 they won two contest in Poland (the 2nd Rally of South-Eastern Poland flying RWD-2 and the 3rd Light Aircraft Contest, flying RWD-4), and in October 1931 they won the 4th Touring Planes Contest, flying on a prototype RWD-5. On August 7, 1931 Żwirko and Stanisław Prauss tried to break another altitude record, on RWD-7, climbing at 5,996 m (19,672 ft), but it was not recognized by the FAI due to a non-standard recording device. In December 1931 Żwirko was assigned a training escadre commander in an aviation school in Dęblin. In April 1932 he was selected for the Polish team for the International Tourist Plane Competition Challenge 1932, taking place between August 20-August 28, 1932, and he chose Wigura as his crewmate. They won the competition, over favourite German and other teams, flying the new RWD-6, and became heroes in Poland. The success was brought by Żwirko's pilotage skills and high quality of the plane, designed among others, by Wigura. On 11 September 1932, flying to an air meeting to Prague, and Wigura fatally crashed in their RWD-6 in the forest at Cierlicko near Cieszyn in Czechoslovakia, when the wing broke in a heavy storm. The two men were buried in the Avenue of the Meritorious in Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw.

He is known as "Nagashime Ouji" (流し目王子) or "Sidelong Glance Prince". His father is the head of the gekidan sujaku theatre troupe, and Saotome grew up within the troupe, performing primarily in taishū engeki. Identified as having a natural talent as an onnagata (female impersonator), he has been trained in that field, and performs in female roles onstage. He has acted in two films by director Takeshi Kitano. In 2003, in Zatoichi, he portrayed the child Seitaro who, when older, disguised himself as a geisha (played by Daigoro Tachibana). Though in a different troupe from Tachibana, the two have frequently practiced and performed together. Saotome was also in Kitano's 2005 film, Takeshis', in which he was credited as himself, playing a young female impersonator and dancer. Saotome also plays young male roles, particularly those with a bishōnen aesthetic, i.e. graceful, beautiful young men. In 2005, he played the role of Mori Ranmaru in a National Museum event called "Sengoku Fantasy", and on New Year's 2007, he played a young Horibe Yasubee in the NHK New Year's jidaigeki play. Though he has not appeared in many films, Saotome has a fan following in the theatre, and his official fan club was established in 2006. He has said that he does not really understand his appeal, but is happy that people of all ages enjoy his performances. His appearance on the variety show D no Gekijō in late January 2007 was one of a number of his events which have generated an overwhelming fan response. It was arranged that he would reprise the same performance, a dance in a flower-decorated kimono, at the Taishōkan, soon afterwards. The performance was sold out the next day. Saotome has expressed a desire to play men's roles and to perform in more mainstream or traditional theatre, saying that he has never much cared for playing female roles. Beginning in October 2010, Saotome will star in the stage production of the otome game, Hakuouki. He has been cast as vice commander, Hijikata Toshizo, of the Shinsengumi.

He became first secretary to Sultan Abdul Hamid II shortly after the Sultan's accession, and is said to have contributed to the realizations of his majesty's design of concentrating power in his own hands; later he became successively minister of the interior and then governor of Bursa, reaching the high post of grand vizier in 1879. He was grand vizier seven more times under Abdul Hamid, and once under his successor, Mehmed V Reşat. He was known for his opposition to the extension of foreign influence in Turkey. In 1896, he took refuge at the British embassy at Istanbul, and, though then assured of his personal liberty and safety, remained practically a prisoner in his own house. He came into temporary prominence again during the revolution of 1908. On 22 July he succeeded Mehmed Ferid Pasha as grand vizier, but on the 6 August was replaced by the more liberal Kâmil Pasha, at the insistence of the Young Turks. Also during 1908, Mehmed Said Pasha bought the famed Istanbul arcade in the Beyoğlu district, today known as Çiçek Pasajı ("Flower Passage"). The modern name became common in the 1940s; during Mehmed Said Pasha's ownership in the 1900s and 1910s, the arcade was known as Sait Paşa Pasajı ("Said Pasha Passage"). During the Italian crisis in 1911–12, he was again called to the premiership. He was again removed from power by the Savior Officers (who backed the Freedom and Accord Party (Liberal Union) against the Committee of Union and Progress) and replaced by a new cabinet supported by the Officers and the Freedom and Accord Party. The CUP would return to power, however, the next year after the Bab-ı Ali coup of 1913.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Itō_Hirobumi	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hikari,_Yamaguchi	(In this Japanese name, the family name is Itō.) Prince Itō Hirobumi (伊藤 博文, October 16, 1841 – October 26, 1909, born Hayashi Risuke and also known as Hirofumi, Hakubun and briefly during his youth Itō Shunsuke) was a Japanese statesman and genrō. A London-educated samurai of the Chōshū Domain and an influential figure in the early Meiji Restoration government, he chaired the bureau which drafted the Meiji Constitution in the 1880s. Looking to the West for legal inspiration, Itō rejected the United States Constitution as too liberal and the Spanish Restoration as too despotic before ultimately drawing on the British and German models, especially the Prussian Constitution of 1850. Dissatisfied with the prominent role of Christianity in European legal traditions, he substituted references to the more traditionally Japanese concept of kokutai or "national polity", which became the constitutional justification for imperial authority. In 1885 he became Japan's first Prime Minister, an office his constitutional bureau had introduced. He went on to hold the position four times, and wielded considerable power even out of office as the occasional head of Emperor Meiji's Privy Council. A monarchist, Itō favoured a large, bureaucratic government and opposed the formation of political parties. His third government was ended by the consolidation of the opposition into the Kenseitō party in 1898, prompting him to found the Rikken Seiyūkai in response. He resigned his fourth and final ministry in 1901 after growing weary of party politics, but served as head of the Privy Council twice more before his death. Itō's foreign policy was ambitious. He strengthened diplomatic ties with Western powers including Germany, the United States and especially the United Kingdom. In Asia he oversaw the First Sino-Japanese War and negotiated Chinese surrender on terms aggressively favourable to Japan, including the annexation of Taiwan and the release of Korea from the tribute system. Itō sought to avoid a Russo-Japanese War through the policy of Man-Kan kōkan – surrendering Manchuria to the Russian sphere of influence in exchange for the acceptance of Japanese hegemony in Korea. A diplomatic tour of the United States and Europe brought him to Saint Petersburg in November 1901, where he was unable to find compromise on this matter with Russian authorities. Soon the government of Katsura Tarō elected to abandon the pursuit of Man-Kan kōkan, and tensions with Russia continued to escalate towards war. The Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905 made Itō the first Japanese Resident-General of Korea. He supported the sovereignty of the indigenous Joseon monarchy as a protectorate under Japan, and in 1909 was forced to resign his position by the increasingly powerful Imperial Japanese Army, which instead favoured the total annexation of Korea. Four months later, Itō was assassinated by Korean nationalist An Jung-geun in Manchuria. His death accelerated the annexation both he and his assassin had opposed; the process was formalised by another treaty the following year. Through his daughter Ikuko, Itō was the father-in-law of politician, intellectual and author Suematsu Kenchō.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Juichi_Yoshikawa	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fukui,_Fukui	Juichi Yoshikawa (吉川壽一 Yoshikawa Juichi) (born 1943 in Fukui, Japan) is a Japanese calligraphist, or sho artist, who studied calligraphy formally under Inamura Undo, and later with Ueda Sokiu. Yoshikawa's avant garde trademark "three and a half dimensions" style applies observation as the additional dimension. To an untrained observer, this approach might be characterized as artistic flamboyance known by the use of giant brushes and stadium-sized canvases - or, as in the large 1990 Beijing installation, by almost completely covering the 5,000 square metres of Tiananmen Square. Yoshikawa's work has been presented throughout Japan, China, and the Middle East, and he is the author of a 1993 French publication on his form, Sho. He has collaborated several times with the lyricist, Chris Mosdell, illustrating what are essentially poetic works with experimental calligraphy. The first collection,Shake the Whole World To Its Foundations (2001 Shichosha Publishing), is an epic rhythmical chant densely type-set on the page with delicate and often simple brush-stroke accompaniments. The second publication, The Erotic Odes: A Pillow Book, couples verse by Mosdell with digitally stylized erotic shunga woodcut prints from the Edo Era overlaid with sensual calligraphy and ink-seepage creations by Yoshikawa. A full-color edition, originally published by Libroport in 1997, was fully color-enhanced and re-printed in 2008 by Seigensha Publishing.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Knox	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allegheny,_Pennsylvania	Hugh Smith Knox (January 27, 1883 – January 2, 1936) was an American football player. He played at the halfback position at Yale University and was selected as a first-team All-American in 1906. Knox was the son of Philander C. Knox, who served as the U.S. Secretary of State under William Howard Taft and U.S. Attorney General under William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. He attended Allegheny Prep School before enrolling at Yale University. While he was a student at a private school in Connecticut, Knox was arrested and charged in May 1903 with assault. The complainant alleged that he had been beaten badly by a group of young men, which included Knox. Because his father was the U.S. Attorney General, the case received coverage in the press. Knox was put on trial in Norwalk, Connecticut, and he was found not guilty. Knox graduated in 1907 from Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. At Yale, Knox played at the halfback position for Yale's football teams in 1905 and 1906. In Yale's 6–0 victory over Harvard in 1906, Knox was credited a 40-yard run that was considered one of the most exciting plays of the 1906 season. The New York Times called it a "magnificent effort" and a "beautiful run" and described Knox "swerving in and picking his way through the broken field ahead, ... dodging one and another of the oncoming Cambridge men." At the conclusion of the 1906 season, Knox was selected as a first-team All-American halfback by both Walter Camp, Caspar Whitney, the New York World and the New York Mail. The New York Times wrote that Knox was "as useful as any man on the field in general work." Knox later served as the private secretary to his father while he served as the U.S. Secretary of State. In 1910, Knox traveled incognito to Southern California to visit with Yale football legend, Walter Camp. The Los Angeles Times reported on Knox's visit as follows: "Short of stature, he bears a striking resemblance to his distinguished father, with the same restless dark eyes and dark hair growing sparse on the forehead. Mr. Knox is a bachelor and has not had the romantic marital history of his two younger brothers." In December 1911, Knox was married at New York's Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church Katherine McCook, the daughter of Anson G. McCook, a member of the "Fighting McCooks," one of the most prolific military families during the American Civil War. The couple planned to live in Washington, D.C. Knox died in 1936 at Ithaca, New York.

The poem is one of the few extant examples of the epic genre and it was both innovative and influential, providing Ptolemaic Egypt with a "cultural mnemonic" or national "archive of images", and offering the Latin poets Virgil and Gaius Valerius Flaccus a model for their own epics. His other poems, which survive only in small fragments, concerned the beginnings or foundations of cities, such as Alexandria and Cnidus – places of interest to the Ptolemies, whom he served as a scholar and librarian at the Library of Alexandria. A literary dispute with Callimachus, another Alexandrian librarian/poet, is a topic much discussed by modern scholars since it is thought to give some insight into their poetry, although there is very little evidence that there ever was such a dispute between the two men. In fact almost nothing at all is known about Apollonius and even his connection with Rhodes is a matter for speculation. Once considered a mere imitator of Homer, and therefore a failure as a poet, his reputation has been enhanced by recent studies, with an emphasis on the special characteristics of Hellenistic poets as scholarly heirs of a long literary tradition writing at a unique time in history.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ogino_Dokuon	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bizen,_Okayama	Ogino Dokuon (荻野 独園, 1819–1895) was a Rinzai rōshi remembered for his daring resistance to religious oppression directed toward Buddhists during the late Tokugawa period and Meiji period of Japan. He received Dharma transmission from his teacher Daisetsu Shōen and later became abbot of Shōkoku-ji in 1879. In 1872 he was appointed director of Daikyō-in, which was an institution of the Meiji government set up that same year in order to "promote the 'prompt modernization' of the nation." Guised as an organization promoting the "Great Teaching" — consisting of Confucian ethics and Shintoism — scholar Heinrich Dumoulin states that, "...one is hard put to find anything Buddhist there. It is no surprise, therefore, that the Buddhists were not very happy with this new decree, even though it did give them a participatory voice in policy matters and introduced a new organizational order." As leader of Daikyō-in Dokuon protested these policies to the government, though with virtually no effect. Even still, he was one of the most outspoken of anyone of his time period in the Buddhist community.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ruth_Cardoso	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Araraquara	Ruth Vilaça Correia Leite Cardoso (September 19, 1930 – June 24, 2008) was a Brazilian anthropologist and a former member of the Faculty of Philosophy, Letters and Human Sciences at the University of São Paulo (FFLCH-USP). She was the wife of 34th President of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and First Lady of her country between January 1, 1995 to January 1, 2003. She held a Ph.D in anthropology from the University of São Paulo. As professor and researcher Cardoso taught at the Latin American College of Social Sciences (Flacso/Unesco), University of Chile (Santiago), Maison des Sciences de L'Homme (Paris), University of California, Berkeley, and Columbia University (New York City). She was an associate member of the Center for Latin American Studies of the University of Cambridge. With her husband, the sociologist and former president of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, she founded and later directed the research institute Cebrap (Centro Brasileiro de Análise e Planejamento – Brazilian Center of Analysis and Planning), which continues to be a leading site of social science research in Brazil. Dr. Cardoso’s academic reputation rests primarily on a series of highly influential articles and book chapters on popular movements and political participation that she published in the 1980s and 1990s. Under Dr. Cardoso, Cebrap created Brazil’s first research group on social movements, helping to legitimate formal academic study of the "new" (non-class) social movements that had emerged in the 1970s. At the same time, she was careful to stress the limits of identity-based and popular movements for political transformation, noting the divisions among them and their frequent dependency on clientelistic relations with the state and political parties. Unlike many academics, Dr. Cardoso also had the opportunity to put some of her theories into practice after her husband was elected president. She transformed the traditional charity approach of other first ladies with her Comunidade Solidária (Solidary Community) programs that stressed the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in state-society partnerships. In addition to executing concrete social programs, Comunidade Solidária also facilitated broad discussions of important social topics, from agrarian reform to the legal status of NGOs, publishing the results of these dialogues. Anthony Hall of the London School of Economics told the BBC after her death that she was instrumental in developing the plan to bundle various social programs together in the way that has become characteristic of the successful Bolsa Familia social program. She published a book about these experiences, Comunidade Solidaria: Fortalecendo a Sociedade, Promovendo O Desenvolvimento (Comunitas, 2002). She transformed the Comunidade Solidaria into an NGO, Comunitas, after her husband left office. She died in São Paulo on June 24, 2008, after suffering a cardiac arrest. She had been discharged from the Sírio-Libanês Hospital the previous day, June 23, 2008, having previously been admitted with chest pains.

He was assassinated in November 1993. His girlfriend and translator Nevval Boz was also assassinated, along with İhsan Hakan, a former PKK member. Prior to his assassination, Ersever had left the army and began speaking to the press, and said he was in charge of JITEM's south-eastern operations. In his resignation statement he said "A gang formed inside the authorized organization in the Southeast is preventing the Turkish nation from seeing the real dimensions of the events taking place there." He published a book on the war with the PKK under the pen-name Ahmet Aydın. His interviews with journalist Soner Yalçın were published in Aydınlık, after which the Military Prosecutor's Office opened an investigation, and took a deposition from Ersever. Ersever's archive went missing after his death, but was later found in the house of Veli Küçük during investigations for the Ergenekon trials.

After his death, Jehovah's Witnesses and numerous independent Bible Student groups developed from this base. In July 1879, Russell began publishing a monthly religious journal, Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence. In 1881 he co-founded Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society with William Henry Conley as president; in 1884 the corporation was officially registered, with Russell as president. Russell wrote many articles, books, tracts, pamphlets and sermons, totaling approximately 50,000 printed pages. From 1886 to 1904, he published a six-volume Bible study series originally entitled Millennial Dawn, later renamed Studies in the Scriptures, nearly 20 million copies of which were printed and distributed around the world in several languages during his lifetime. (A seventh volume was commissioned by his successor as society president, Joseph Rutherford, and published in 1917.) The Watch Tower Society ceased publication of Russell's writings in 1927, though his books are still published by several independent groups. After Russell's death, a crisis arose surrounding Rutherford's leadership of the society, culminating in a movement-wide schism. As many as three-quarters of the approximately 50,000 Bible Students who had been associating in 1917 had left by 1931. This shift resulted in the formation of several groups that retained variations on the name Bible Students. Those who maintained fellowship with the Watch Tower Society adopted the name Jehovah's witnesses in 1931, while those who severed ties with the Society formed their own groups including the Pastoral Bible Institute in 1918, the Laymen's Home Missionary Movement in 1919, and the Dawn Bible Students Association in 1929.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abbas_I_of_Persia	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herat,_Iran	Shāh Abbās the Great or Shāh Abbās I of Persia (Persian: شاه عباس بزرگ‎‎; 27 January 1571 – 19 January 1629) was the 5th Safavid Shah (king) of Iran, and is generally considered the strongest ruler of the Safavid dynasty. He was the third son of Shah Mohammad Khodabanda. Although Abbas would preside over the apex of the Iranian Safavid Empire's military, political and economic power, he came to the throne during a troubled time for Iran. Under his weak-willed father, the country was riven with discord between the different factions of the Qizilbash army, who killed Abbas' mother and elder brother. Meanwhile, Iran's enemies, the Ottoman Empire (its archrival) and the Uzbeks, exploited this political chaos to seize territory for themselves. In 1588, one of the Qizilbash leaders, Murshid Qoli Khan, overthrew Shah Mohammed in a coup and placed the 16-year-old Abbas on the throne. But Abbas was no puppet and soon seized power for himself. Under his leadership, Abbas created numerous opportunities for thousands of Circassians, Georgians, and Armenians to join the civil administration and the military. With the help of these newly created layers in Iranian society (initiated by his predecessors but significantly expanded during his rule), Abbas managed to completely crush and diminish the power of the Qizilbash in the civil administration, the royal house and the military. These actions, as well as his reforms of the Iranian army, enabled him to fight the Ottomans and Uzbeks and reconquer Iran's lost provinces. By the end of the 1603-1618 Ottoman War, Abbas had regained possession over Transcaucasia and Dagestan, as well as swaths of Eastern Anatolia and Mesopotamia; the latter two were territories which had been lost as a result of the 1555 Peace of Amasya. He also took back land from the Portuguese and the Mughals and expanded Iranian rule and influence in the North Caucasus, beyond the traditional territories of Dagestan. Abbas was a great builder and moved his kingdom's capital from Qazvin to Isfahan, making the city the pinnacle of Safavid architecture. In his later years, following a court intrigue involving several leading Circassians, Abbas became suspicious of his own sons and had them killed or blinded.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chiyonofuji_Mitsugu	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fukushima,_Hokkaido	Chiyonofuji Mitsugu (千代の富士 貢) (June 1, 1955 – July 31, 2016), born Mitsugu Akimoto (秋元 貢 Akimoto Mitsugu), was a Japanese champion sumo wrestler and the 58th yokozuna of the sport. Following his retirement as a wrestler, he was the stable master of Kokonoe stable until the time of his death. Chiyonofuji was considered one of the greatest yokozuna of recent times, winning 31 yūshō or tournament championships, second at the time only to Taihō. He was particularly remarkable for his longevity in sumo's top rank, which he held for a period of ten years from 1981 to 1991. Promoted at the age of twenty-six after winning his second championship, his performance improved with age, winning more tournaments in his thirties than any other wrestler and dominating the sport in the second half of the 1980s. He finally retired in May 1991, just short of his thirty-sixth birthday. This is in contrast to most recent yokozuna who have tended to retire around 30. During his 21-year professional career Chiyonofuji set records for most career victories (1045) and most wins in the top makuuchi division (807), earning an entry in the Guinness World Records. Both of these records were later broken by Kaiō Hiroyuki. He won the Kyushu tournament, one of the six annual honbasho, a record eight consecutive years from 1981 until 1988, and also set the record for the longest postwar run of consecutive wins (53 bouts in 1988). That record stood for 22 years until Hakuhō broke it with his 54th straight win in September 2010. In a sport where weight is often regarded as vital, Chiyonofuji was quite light at around 120 kg (260 lb). He relied on superior technique and muscle to defeat opponents. He was the lightest yokozuna since Tochinoumi in the 1960s. Upon his retirement he became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association and became the Kokonoe-oyakata the following year.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gertrude_Stein	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allegheny,_Pennsylvania	Gertrude Stein (February 3, 1874 – July 27, 1946) was an American novelist, poet, playwright, and art collector. Born in the Allegheny West neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and raised in Oakland, California, Stein moved to Paris in 1903, and made France her home for the remainder of her life. She hosted a Paris salon, where the leading figures in modernism in literature and art, such as Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, Ezra Pound, and Henri Matisse would meet. In 1933, Stein published a kind of memoir of her Paris years, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, written in the voice of her life partner, Alice B. Toklas. Toklas was an American-born member of the Parisian avant-garde. The book became a literary bestseller and vaulted Stein from the relative obscurity of the cult literarure scene into the limelight of mainstream attention. Two quotes from her works have become widely known: "Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose" and "there is no there there", with the latter often taken to be a reference to her childhood home of Oakland, California. Her books include Q.E.D. (Quod Erat Demonstrandum) (1903), about a lesbian romantic affair involving several of Stein's female friends; Fernhurst, a fictional story about a romantic affair; Three Lives (1905–06) and The Making of Americans (1902-1911). In Tender Buttons (1914), Stein commented on lesbian sexuality. Her activities during World War II have been the subject of analysis and commentary. As a Jew living in Nazi-occupied France, Stein may have only been able to sustain her lifestyle as an art collector, and indeed to ensure her physical safety, through the protection of powerful Vichy government official and Nazi collaborator Bernard Faÿ. After the war ended, Stein expressed admiration for another Nazi collaborator, Vichy leader Marshall Pétain. Some have argued that certain accounts of Stein's wartime activities have amounted to a "witch hunt".

In the eighteenth century, topics such as politics and war were thought to be the province of men. Few men and fewer women had the education or training to write about these subjects. Warren was an exception. During the years before the American Revolution, Warren published poems and plays that attacked royal authority in Massachusetts and urged colonists to resist British infringements on colonial rights and liberties. During the debate over the United States Constitution in 1788, she issued a pamphlet, Observations on the new Constitution, and on the Federal and State Conventions written under the pseudonym "A Columbian Patriot," that opposed ratification of the document and advocated the inclusion of a Bill of Rights. Observations was long thought to be the work of other writers, most notably Elbridge Gerry. It was not until her descendant, Charles Warren, found a reference to it in a 1787 letter to British historian, Catharine Macaulay, that Warren was accredited authorship. In 1790, she published a collection of poems and plays under her own name, a highly unusual occurrence for a woman at the time. In 1805, she published one of the earliest histories of the American Revolution, a three-volume History of the Rise, Progress, and Termination of the American Revolution, the first history of the American Revolution authored by a woman.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lois_Weber	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allegheny,_Pennsylvania	Lois Weber (June 13, 1879 – November 13, 1939) was an American silent film actress, screenwriter, producer, and director, who is considered "the most important female director the American film industry has known", and "one of the most important and prolific film directors in the era of silent films". Film historian Anthony Slide asserts that: "Along with D.W. Griffith, Lois Weber was the American cinema's first genuine auteur, a filmmaker involved in all aspects of production and one who utilized the motion picture to put across her own ideas and philosophies." Weber produced an oeuvre comparable to Griffith in both quantity and quality, and brought to the screen her concerns for humanity and social justice in an estimated 200 to 400 films, of which as few as twenty have been preserved, and has been credited by IMDb with directing 135 films, writing 114, and acting in 100. Weber was "one of the first directors to come to the attention of the censors in Hollywood's early years". Weber has been credited as pioneering the use of the split screen technique to show simultaneous action in her 1913 film Suspense. In collaboration with her first husband, Phillips Smalley, in 1913 Weber was "one of the first directors to experiment with sound", making the first sound films in the United States, and was also the first American woman to direct a full-length feature film when she and Smalley directed The Merchant of Venice in 1914, and in 1917 the first woman director to own her own film studio. During the war years, Weber "achieved tremendous success by combining a canny commercial sense with a rare vision of cinema as a moral tool". At her zenith, "few men, before or since, have retained such absolute control over the films they have directed – and certainly no women directors have achieved the all-embracing, powerful status once held by Lois Weber." By 1920, Weber was considered the "premier woman director of the screen and author and producer of the biggest money making features in the history of the film business". Among Weber's notable films are: the controversial Hypocrites, which featured the first full-frontal female nude scene in 1915; the 1916 film Where Are My Children?, which discussed abortion and birth control, and was added to the National Film Registry in 1993; her adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan of the Apes novel for the first ever, Tarzan of the Apes film in 1918; and what is often considered her masterpiece, The Blot in 1921. Weber is credited with discovering, mentoring, or making stars of several women actors, including Mary MacLaren, Mildred Harris, Claire Windsor, Esther Ralston, Billie Dove, Ella Hall, Cleo Ridgely, and Anita Stewart, and discovered and inspired screenwriter Frances Marion. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, on February 8, 1960, Weber was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susumu_Hirasawa	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adachi,_Tokyo	Susumu Hirasawa (平沢 進) (born April 1, 1954) is a Japanese music artist and composer. In the fifth year of elementary school, Hirasawa took up the electric guitar, inspired by the surf and instrumental rock bands he heard on the radio and on TV, later joining his junior high school's band. In 1973 he formed Mandrake, a progressive rock band that incorporated elements from heavy metal and krautrock. Being one of the few Japanese progressive rock bands of its time, Mandrake achieved little success and released no albums during its lifetime. After discovering punk rock and working on synthesizer-heavy projects, Hirasawa felt that progressive rock became just for entertainment and decided to reform the band as the new wave/electronic rock band P-Model in 1979. Originally met with success, they turned to decidedly uncommercial post-punk and experimental rock after Hirasawa went through an averse reaction to his fame. With Hirasawa at the forefront, the band went through various lineups and achieved some popularity in the Japanese independent music scene. In 1989, Hirasawa launched his solo career. Unbound by the restraints of a band, his albums were marked by a refusal to stick to any particular genre. He continued to evolve his sound while concurrently working with P-Model until the group was disbanded in 2000. He has actively been releasing new music since. While Hirasawa is mostly remembered in Japan for the first two P-Model albums, he has achieved international recognition for his soundtrack work, particularly for the adaptations of the Kentaro Miura manga Berserk and the work of anime director Satoshi Kon.

After graduating from Warsaw Technical High School, he entered the law school at Moscow University. In 1917 he was drafted into the Russian Army and served as an ensign in the 42nd reserve regiment. Following the October Revolution, he joined the Cheka, and because of his facility with languages—he spoke French, Polish, German, and Russian—he became a member of the Foreign Department. In 1926 he was stationed in Mongolia, perhaps reporting to Yakov Blumkin, where he conducted active intelligence work against China and Japan. In 1930 Spigelglas became the chief undercover agent of the OGPU, later the NKVD, in Paris. As a cover for his operations, he worked as the bourgeois proprietor of a fish store near the Boulevard Montmartre. Spigelglas's main task was spying on the White Russian and Trotskyist organizations in Paris, where he controlled the penetration agents Mark Zborowski and Roland Abbiate. He successfully recruited the double agent Nikolai Skoblin and his wife Nadezhda Plevitskaya. Spigelglas returned to Moscow, where he trained new agents in counterintelligence and acted as deputy director of the Foreign Department reporting to Abram Slutsky. His particular forte was the liternoye (top secret) or liquidation operation. He engineered the assassination of the Ukrainian nationalist Yevhen Konovalets in Rotterdam in May 1938, the execution of the defector Ignace Reiss in Switzerland in September 1937, and the kidnapping of the leader of Russian All-Military Union (ROVS), General Evgenii Miller, in France in September 1937. It has also been suggested that he was the mastermind behind the murder-decapitation of the Trotskyist leader of the Fourth International, Rudolf Klement, in France in July 1938, and the murder of the defector Georges Agabekov in France in 1937. When Slutsky died in February 1938, poisoned by order of Nikolai Yezhov, Spigelglas became the acting director of foreign intelligence. The head of the NKVD, Lavrenti Beria, had Spigelglas arrested seven months later on November 2, 1938. He was held in Lefortovo prison and attempted a hunger strike which failed once his jailers began a regimen of intravenous feeding. After "strong pressure," a euphemism for torture, he began to make a confession in May 1939, and a tribunal convicted him of treachery on November 28, 1940. (In his confession, Spigelglas claimed that Lev Sedov died of natural causes, not the victim of NKVD foul play.) He was executed on January 29, 1941. Historical opinion on Spigelglas is divided. Some, following the lead of Alexander Orlov, portray him as a "careerist" ready to liquidate dozens of honest people to advance himself, a man who could disingenuously claim that the deaths of those he murdered were necessary in the Bolshevik's struggle against their enemies. Others, following Sudoplatov, believe he was polite, business-like, intelligent, and a patriot. The Russian government rehabilitated him in 1991.	
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cai_Tingkai	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luoding	Cai Tingkai (simplified Chinese: 蔡廷锴; traditional Chinese: 蔡廷鍇; pinyin: Cài Tíngkǎi; Wade–Giles: Ts'ai T'ing-k'ai; 1892–1968) was a Chinese general. Cai was in overall command of the 19th Route Army of the Republic of China's National Revolutionary Army and other Chinese forces responsible for holding off the Imperial Japanese Army during the Shanghai War of 1932 on 28 January 1932. In November 1933, Cai and fellow 19th Route Army officer Li Jishen rebelled against the ruling Kuomintang regime and, with Jiang Guangnai, they established the Fujian People's Government, on 22 November 1933. However the rebellion, known as the Fujian Incident, did not receive Communist support and, on 21 January 1934, it was defeated by the Kuomintang and Cai was forced to leave China for several years. Later, in the Second Sino-Japanese War (World War II), Cai offered to return to command and returned to command the 26th Army Group in the Battle of South Guangxi. He also traveled to the United States to gain support from Chinese Americans for the war effort. During the final stages of the Chinese Civil War, Cai supported the Chinese Communists and was a signer of the "Proclamation of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China" of 1 October 1949. Cai was originally interred at the Beijing Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery but, since 1997, his remains have been at the Memorial Mausoleum of the Martyrs of Nineteenth Route Army in the Battle Against Japanese Aggressors at North Shanghai.	
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bibi_Khanoom_Astarabadi	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Now_Kandeh	Bibi Khānoom Astarābādi (Persian: بی بی خانوم استرآبادی‎‎)‎ (1858/9–1921) was a notable Iranian writer, satirist, and one of the pioneering figures in the women's movement of Iran. Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi was born to the family of Mohammad Baqer Khan Astarabadi, one of the notable men of Astarabad (the present-day Gorgan), and Khadijeh Khanom (خديجه خانم), known as Mollah Bāji (ملاباجی), one of the companions of Shokuh ol-Saltaneh (شکوه السلطنه), wife to Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar. The title Mollah Bāji (see Mollah) is indicative that she must have been educated and in charge of more than the daily household chores of Shah's Court. Indeed, she has been in charge of the education of the children in the court of Nasser al-Din Shah. At the age of 22, Bibi Khatoon married Musa Khan Vaziri who was a prominent official in the Persian Cossack Brigade. They had seven children, of whom the most distinguished are Colonel Ali-Naqi Vaziri (musicologist, composer, a celebrated player of the tar, and the founder of the Academy of Music of Iran as well of Iran's National Orchestra), and Hasan Vaziri (an artistic painter). Dr Mah-Laghā Mallah (دكتر مه لقا ملاح), founder and director of Iran's "Women's Society against Environmental Pollution" (founded in 1992 to educate children and mothers, as well as state's officials, about dangers of environmental pollution) is the maternal granddaughter of Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi. Bibi Khatoon was one of the influential figures in the Iranian constitutional revolution in the late 19th and the early 20th century. She founded the first school for girls (named The School for Girls — دبستان دوشیزگان) in the modern history of Iran and wrote numerous articles in defence of the right of girls to receive universal education. Her articles appeared in such newspapers as Tamaddon (تمدن - Civilization), Habl al-Matin (حبل المتين - Firm Rope) and Majles (مجلس - Parliament). Bibi Khatoon is also known for her book Ma'ayeb al-Rejal (معايب الرجال - Failings of Men), which was a critical response to the pamphlet Ta'deeb al-Nesvan (تاديب النسوان - Edification of Women) by an anonymous author. Ma'ayeb al-Rejal was published in 1895, eleven years before the inauguration of Iran's system of constitutional monarchy in 1906 by the decree of Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar. This book is considered by some as the first declaration of women's rights in the recent history of Iran.

The Thaw family wealth allowed them to buy the silence of those individuals who threatened to make public the worst of Thaw’s reckless behavior and licentious transgressions. Throughout his life, however, he had several serious confrontations with the criminal justice system, which resulted in his incarceration in mental institutions. Thaw shot and killed Stanford White as a result of his jealousy over the relationship between his wife, Evelyn Nesbit, and White. After one hung jury, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity. Years later, White's son Lawrence Grant White would write, "On the night of June 25th, 1906, while attending a performance at Madison Square Garden, Stanford White was shot from behind [by] a crazed profligate whose great wealth was used to besmirch his victim's memory during the series of notorious trials that ensued."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rouvaun	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bingham_Canyon,_Utah	Rouvaun (1932–1975) was born Jim Haun in Bingham, Utah. A child singer with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in Salt Lake City, he went on to study voice at the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music and perform with the Beverly Hills Opera Company. Nonetheless, he remained a struggling woodworker studying voice. Rouvaun was a virtual unknown until February 5, 1967, when he appeared in Las Vegas as the headline singer leading the 100-person Frederick Apcar French stage review Casino De Paris at the Dunes Hotel. His first record label, KALAMO, described him on his debut album cover as "The World's Greatest Singer". Nicknamed "The Vocal Vesuvius", Rouvaun continued performing on stage to sellout crowds and recorded a number of albums (see below). His career seemed to be blossoming until tragedy struck in 1975, when Rouvaun collapsed and died at age 43 due to massive internal hemorrhaging. Apparently the strain on his vocal cords had caused his esophagus to rupture. Rouvaun's rise to stardom was not by accident. His first vocal coach was Mario Chamlee, a famed tenor among the many who tried to succeed Enrico Caruso at the Metropolitan Opera in the 1920s. Rouvaun then studied with Mario Silva, acclaimed voice coach of Mario Lanza. His singing career led to big city and foreign concerts. His hobbies included foreign cars, riding his motorcycle, target shooting, listening to jazz, and painting landscapes and seascapes in oil. He was marketed and promoted by Tony Alamo, who later became a notorious Christian minister.

He is the founder of the Gülen movement (known as Hizmet meaning service in Turkish), and the inspiration figure for its largest organization, the Alliance for Shared Values. He currently lives in self-imposed exile in the United States, residing in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania. Gülen teaches a Hanafi version of Islam, deriving from Sunni Muslim scholar Said Nursî's teachings. Gülen has stated that he believes in science, interfaith dialogue among the People of the Book, and multi-party democracy. He has initiated such dialogue with the Vatican and some Jewish organizations. Gülen is actively involved in the societal debate concerning the future of the Turkish state, and Islam in the modern world. He has been described in the English-language media as an imam "who promotes a tolerant Islam which emphasises altruism, hard work and education" and as "one of the world's most important Muslim figures." Gülen was an ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan before 2013. The alliance was destroyed after the 2013 corruption investigations in Turkey. Erdogan accused Gülen of being behind the corruption investigations. He is currently on Turkey's most-wanted-terrorist list and is accused of leading what the current Turkish officials call the Gulenist Terror Organisation (FETÖ). A Turkish criminal court issued an arrest warrant for Gülen. Turkey is demanding the extradition of Gülen from the United States.

He was the son of a wealthy Japanese merchant, and attended the prestigious Keio University. While in university, Nosaka became interested in social movements, and joined a moderate labor organization after graduation, working as a research staff member, and as a writer and editor of the organization's magazine. He traveled to Britain in 1919 to study political economy, where he deepened his studies of Marxism and became a confirmed communist. Nosaka was a founding member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, but his activity within British communist circles led to him being deported from Britain in 1921. After leaving Britain, Nosaka traveled through the Soviet Union (USSR). He returned to Japan in 1922, where he co-founded the Japanese Communist Party (JCP). Nosaka became a labor organizer, but was arrested twice by the Japanese government for his activities. After being released from prison a second time, Nosaka secretly returned to the USSR in 1931, where he became an agent of the Comintern. He traveled to the West Coast of the United States, where he worked as a communist spy from 1934-1938. After leaving the United States, Nosaka worked in China from 1940–1945, supporting the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) by encouraging and recruiting captured Japanese soldiers to support and fight for the Chinese communists against the Imperial Japanese Army, and coordinating a spy network that operated throughout Japanese-occupied China. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Nosaka returned to Japan with hundreds of other Japanese communists, where he led the Japanese Communist Party during the occupation of Japan. Nosaka attempted to brand the JCP as a populist party supporting Japan's peaceful transition into socialism, but his strategy was criticized within the party and within the Soviet Union. During the Korean War the JCP temporarily endorsed violence, and Nosaka disappeared from public life and went underground. He re-emerged to lead the JCP again in 1955, after which he attempted to disrupt the US-Japan Security Treaty by organizing public demonstrations, but he generally supported the JCP's role as a peaceful party. In 1958 Nosaka became Chairman of the JCP, a position he held until retirement at the age of 90, after which he was declared Honorary Chairman. Nosaka joined the faculty of Keio University, and he was widely idolized among left-wing intellectuals until shortly before his death, when the fall of the Soviet Union exposed controversial aspects of his relationship with Stalin's Communist regime.

While he is known primarily as a comedian and TV host in his native Japan, abroad he is known exclusively for his filmwork. With the exception of his works as a film director, he is known almost exclusively by the stage name Beat Takeshi (ビートたけし Bīto Takeshi). Kitano rose to prominence in the 1970s as one half of the comedy duo Two Beat, before going solo and becoming one of the three biggest comedians in the country. After several small acting roles, he made his directorial debut with 1989's Violent Cop and garnered international acclaim for Sonatine (1993). But he was not accepted as a director in Japan until Hana-bi won the Golden Lion in 1997. He has received critical acclaim for his idiosyncratic cinematic work, winning numerous awards with Japanese film critic Nagaharu Yodogawa having once dubbed him "the true successor" to influential filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. Many of Kitano's films are dramas about yakuza gangsters or the police. Described by critics as using an acting style that is highly deadpan or a camera style that approaches near-stasis, Kitano often uses long takes where little appears to be happening, or editing that cuts immediately to the aftermath of an event. Many of his films express a bleak or nihilistic philosophy, but they are also filled with humor and affection for their characters.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sessue_Hayakawa	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chiba,_Chiba	Sessue Hayakawa (早川 雪洲 Hayakawa Sesshū, June 10, 1889 – November 23, 1973) was a Japanese actor who starred in American, French, German, British, and Japanese films. Hayakawa was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood during the silent era of the 1910s and 1920s. He was the first actor of Asian descent to find stardom as a leading man in the United States and Europe. His "broodingly handsome" good looks and typecasting as an exotic villain with sexual dominance made him a heartthrob among American women during a time of racial discrimination, and he became one of the first male sex symbols of Hollywood. During those early years, Hayakawa was as well known and as popular as Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks, although today his name is largely unknown to the public. His popularity, sex appeal, and extravagant lifestyle (e.g., his wild parties and his gold-plated Pierce-Arrow) unsettled many segments of American society which were already filled with feelings of the "yellow peril". With the rising tensions between Japan and the United States, Japanese actors were no longer welcome in Hollywood. Following the end of the war, Asian characters were depicted in a desexualized fashion in modern Hollywood and in the wider society, as exemplified by the controversial character of I.Y. Yunioshi in Breakfast At Tiffany's. Hayakawa refused to adopt the negative stereotypes. He abandoned Hollywood for European cinema and there he was treated equally. Hayakawa's friendships with American actors led him to return to Hollywood. He was one of the highest paid stars of his time, earning $5,000 per week in 1915, and $2 million per year through his own production company during the 1920s. He starred in over eighty movies, and two of his films stand in the United States National Film Registry. Of his English-language films, Hayakawa is probably best known for his role as Colonel Saito in the film The Bridge on the River Kwai, for which he received a nomination for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1957. He also appeared in the 1950 film Three Came Home and as the pirate leader in Disney's Swiss Family Robinson in 1960. In addition to his film acting career, Hayakawa was a theatre actor, film and theatre producer, film director, screenwriter, novelist, martial artist, member of the French Resistance, and a Zen master.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saul_Bellow	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montreal	Saul Bellow (born Solomon Bellows; 10 June 1915 – 5 April 2005) was a Canadian-American writer. For his literary work, Bellow was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, the Nobel Prize for Literature, and the National Medal of Arts. He is the only writer to win the National Book Award for Fiction three times and he received the National Book Foundation's lifetime Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 1990. In the words of the Swedish Nobel Committee, his writing exhibited "the mixture of rich picaresque novel and subtle analysis of our culture, of entertaining adventure, drastic and tragic episodes in quick succession interspersed with philosophic conversation, all developed by a commentator with a witty tongue and penetrating insight into the outer and inner complications that drive us to act, or prevent us from acting, and that can be called the dilemma of our age." His best-known works include The Adventures of Augie March, Henderson the Rain King, Herzog, Mr. Sammler's Planet, Seize the Day, Humboldt's Gift and Ravelstein. Widely regarded as one of the 20th century's greatest authors, Bellow has had a "huge literary influence." Bellow said that of all his characters Eugene Henderson, of Henderson the Rain King, was the one most like himself. Bellow grew up as an insolent slum kid, a "thick-necked" rowdy, and an immigrant from Quebec. As Christopher Hitchens describes it, Bellow's fiction and principal characters reflect his own yearning for transcendence, a battle "to overcome not just ghetto conditions but also ghetto psychoses." Bellow's protagonists, in one shape or another, all wrestle with what Corde (Albert Corde, the dean in "The Dean's December") called "the big-scale insanities of the 20th century." This transcendence of the "unutterably dismal" (a phrase from Dangling Man) is achieved, if it can be achieved at all, through a "ferocious assimilation of learning" (Hitchens) and an emphasis on nobility.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Pinker	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montreal	Steven Arthur "Steve" Pinker (born September 18, 1954) is a Canadian-born American cognitive scientist, psychologist, linguist, and popular science author. He is Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University, and is known for his advocacy of evolutionary psychology and the computational theory of mind. Pinker's academic specializations are visual cognition and psycholinguistics. His experimental subjects include mental imagery, shape recognition, visual attention, children's language development, regular and irregular phenomena in language, the neural bases of words and grammar, and the psychology of cooperation and communication, including euphemism, innuendo, emotional expression, and common knowledge. He has written two technical books which proposed a general theory of language acquisition and applied it to children's learning of verbs. In particular, his work with Alan Prince published in 1989 critiqued the connectionist model of how children acquire the past tense of English verbs, arguing instead that children use default rules such as adding "-ed" to make regular forms, sometimes in error, but are obliged to learn irregular forms one by one. In his popular books, he has argued that the human faculty for language is an instinct, an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of seven books for a general audience. Five of these, namely The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and The Stuff of Thought (2007) describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. The sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand. Pinker has been named as one of the world's most influential intellectuals by various magazines. He has won awards from the American Psychological Association, the National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Institution, the Cognitive Neuroscience Society and the American Humanist Association. He delivered the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh in 2013. He has served on the editorial boards of a variety of journals, and on the advisory boards of several institutions. He has frequently participated in public debates on science and society and is a regular contributor to the online science and culture digest 3 Quarks Daily.	
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darlene_Gillespie	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montreal	Gillespie was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. At age ten, she started singing lessons with Glen Raikes, and even took dance lessons with Burch Mann, founder of the American Folk Ballet Company. She auditioned for The Mickey Mouse Club in March 1955, was hired, and appeared on the program for all three seasons of its original run. She was the leading female singer and starred in the serial Corky and White Shadow during the first season. In the third season, she appeared in the serial The New Adventures of Spin and Marty with Tim Considine and David Stollery. She was cast as Dorothy in a musical number from the proposed live-action Disney film Rainbow Road to Oz on an episode of the Disneyland television series in September 1957. The movie was never made, and after The Mickey Mouse Club stopped filming in 1958, her short acting career neared its end. Her last television appearance was as Beth Brian in the 1962 episode "The Star" of the NBC family drama series National Velvet starring Lori Martin as a budding thoroughbred rider. Gillespie made many recordings under the various Disney labels, including an album of 1950s rock and roll standards called Darlene of the Teens (1957). She recorded albums from Disney animated films in which she not only sang but narrated the stories, such as Alice in Wonderland and Sleeping Beauty.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude_Poirier	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montreal	Claude Poirier (born October 26, 1938 in Montreal, Quebec) is a negotiator and crime reporter for the Quebec-based Canadian French-language television network TVA. He is best known for negotiating with suspects during hostage situations. His 50-year career as a legal chronicler started in 1960 when he did the description of a bank robbery. He continued to do the job for several months without receiving a salary. Soon after, he covered the assassinations of U.S. former president John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert Kennedy as well as civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1960s. In Quebec, he covered the kidnapping and subsequent murder of former Quebec Liberal Minister of Labor Pierre Laporte, by the FLQ militant group in 1970. He has, perhaps unwillingly, rebaptised the RCMP (Gendarmerie Royale du Canada in French) la "Genmarderie Royale du Canada" ("marde" is a slang term for excrement in French). Rumour has it that he does it on purpose because of a grudge he has against them. Due to such events, he is often the central character of several funny anecdotes in comedy routines. During his career he participated in numerous inquiries and trials as an expert and as a witness. He covered the publicized biker gang war that occurred in the province of Quebec during the 1990s as well as criminal trials of well-publicized murder or other crime cases such as the trial of several biker gang members arrested during a province-wide police raid operation called "Printemps 2001" which significantly reduced their criminal activities around the province. During hostage situations or other events, some criminals often asked police for a negotiation with Poirier. In August 2007, he has been heavily involved over the well-publicized case of the disappearance of a 10-year-old girl, Cédrika Provencher, in Trois-Rivières, in a possible case of abduction. He received the Medal of Bravery by the Canadian government in 1977 while the Quebec government honoured him five times during his career. Today, he still gives his comments on recent crime cases or cold ones on the TVA news bulletin at 5:00PM EDT on weekdays and during the LCN morning show. During his commentary, he also discusses the juridical system as well as federal or provincial governmental intervention or laws related to crime measures such as gun control, prison sentences and many more. He is also the host of Le Vrai Négociateur on LCN, a 60-minute show that discusses various cases involving the juridical system in Quebec or Canada as well as various crime or disappearance cases. He also plays an important role in the production of the television series "Le Negociateur" which aired in 2005. The second season began on October 23, 2006, on the TVA television network. The series features well-known figures in Quebec culture such as Elvis Gratton star actor Julien Poulin, Frederick de Grandpré, Pierre Curzi, Les Boys actors Serge Thériault and Roc Lafortune, 2004 Star Académie winner Stephanie Lapointe and Guillaume Lemay-Thivierge.

During his 22-year career, he worked for numerous promotions including the World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment (WWF/WWE), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW). Benoit is often cited as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time; pre-eminent industry historian Dave Meltzer considered him "one of the top 10, maybe even the top 5, all-time greats". Benoit held 22 titles between WWF/WWE, WCW, NJPW, and ECW. He was a two-time world champion, having been a one-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion, and a one-time World Heavyweight Champion in WWE; he was booked to win a third world championship at a WWE event on the night of his death. Benoit was the twelfth WWE Triple Crown Champion and sixth WCW Triple Crown Champion, and the second of five men in history to achieve both the WWE and WCW Triple Crown Championships. He was also the 2004 Royal Rumble winner, joining Shawn Michaels as the only two men to win a Royal Rumble as the number one entrant. Benoit headlined multiple pay-per-views for WWE, including a victory in the World Heavyweight Championship main event match of WrestleMania XX in 2004. Benoit murdered his wife and son on June 22, 2007, and subsequently hanged himself on June 24, 2007. Research suggests depression and brain damage accrued from numerous concussions are likely contributing factors leading to Benoit's crime.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kevin_Beamish	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montreal	Kevin Keith Beamish was born in Montreal Canada, but is a naturalized American record producer, sound engineer and mixer. His family relocated to New York City, NY during his childhood when his father took a professors position and continued his education towards his PhD. Kevin played stick ball in the streets and slipped onto the train to see The NY Yankees, much to his parents surprise. Kevin excelled in school and skipped a grade, while studying woodwind instruments and singing with his mother, Mary Francis Ross Beamish, an opera and classical music lover. He became a naturalized American citizen at the age of 9. His family relocated again, this time to Modesto, California when his father took a position as the Dean of Students in a prestigious university in the San Francisco area. His father, Jerome J. Beamish garnered three PhD's during his lifetime as an educator and scholar. Beamish graduated from the University of Berkeley, CA in advanced mathematics and studies in physics and music. Classically trained on woodwind instruments, he secured a recording deal for his band "The Weathervane" by the age of 16. Beamish, a guitar player, keyboardist and singer would venture out to concerts in the local San Francisco area where the music scene of the 60's was breaking out. He watched and listened to the music of Jefferson Airplane and Janis Joplan, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Bob Dylan, The Grateful Dead, The Who and The Beatles on their American tour. This glimpse of the early 60's was his entrance into music, knowing exactly what he wanted to do. This love and immediate step into the industry stopped his own PhD move into a scholarship to a prestigious university, disappointing his father and mother, but who quickly realized he was on the right path. After a backpack tour of Europe with coins in his pocket and a rest from heavy studies, he returned to California, and sent out letters to every studio in L.A. Only one came back, Crystal Recording Studio's who hired him to be a studio assistant; short for make coffee, answer the phones and stand in the studio all day and night, learning and helping. While there on his first week, James Taylor was recording "Mud Slide Slim" and Jackson Browne was recording "The Pretender." He was on the other side of the studio but could hear these sounds while he cleaned and worked. His entrance into recording was while assisting on Cisco Kid by War, and offering a few lines to help them when they were stuck. Their songs were long, cascading jams and they were short on lyrics. Beamish, who had been writing poetry since the age of 5, quickly added a few ideas, naively. Told quickly by a manager (after they used a few words he suggested), to never mention it again; when Beamish asked how he would be credited. This was a quick study on the publishing business and perils of the business. While assisting in engineering and any and all studio help to the then key engineers, he learned the difference between the producer and the engineer. Steve Wonder was recording at Crystal and would find Kevin intuitively. Beamish stated that no matter how many knobs were on a board, Stevie knew every single setting. If you moved one a minuscule of an inch to the left or right, he would know. And no matter what, he could record and know when to punch in, punch out, come in and fade, with no sight. During this time at Crystal, the Miracles were recording and as the story goes, the Producer who started the project got a call for a family emergency. Beamish had been staying up nights in the studio remixing old tapes, learning and absorbing every note and every effect, creating his own original sounds, mesmerized with amps as a guitar player and creating sounds.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Clewes	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montreal	Peter Clewes is a Canadian architect and the principal of the Toronto-based firm architectsAlliance. He has been one of the leading architects in the condo boom that has reshaped Toronto in the first decade of the 21st century. His projects include SP!RE, Casa Condominio Residenza, Murano, Burano, X Condominium, 20 Niagara, Ideal Lofts, and MoZo. He most often works for Howard Cohen of Context Developments. Clewes designed buildings can be described as neomodern. He is notable for creating unadorned towers with large expanses of glass and well thought out interior layouts. He is a critic of neo-historical and postmodern structures, arguing there is no reason to force tiny windows and aged styles when modern technology can create expansive floor to ceiling windows. He has argued forcefully against contextualism, and has not employed it for projects such as his Distillery District designs. He told the Globe and Mail "We need to create buildings of our time. Architecture is a record of where a city and a culture was at a particular time." His designs have been well received by customers and critics. Christopher Hume is one of his strongest advocates. Hume, the architecture critic for the Toronto Star, has given rare A ratings to several of Clewes' designs and has called him "the leading condo designer of his generation" Originally from Montreal, Clewes studied at the University of Waterloo. From university he gained a co-op placement with the renowned Arthur Erickson. He then joined Erickson's firm in Toronto. With Erickson he participated in a number of major projects, including the Canadian Embassy in Washington. In 1986, he left to help form a separate practice, Wallman Clewes Bergman. Wallman Clewes Bergman merged with Van Nostrand DiCastri Architects in 1999 to form architectsAlliance. Clewes has taught at the University of Toronto and is a currently a member of the Toronto Waterfront Design Review Panel.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ken_Evoy	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montreal	Ken Evoy (born September 25, 1953 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada) is the founder and Chairman of the Board of SiteSell and was one of Canada's most productive toy makers in the 1990s. Evoy's game design company (named Isovoy Inc. - a mix of his and his wife's surnames) went on to create and license more than 20 toy creations between 1985 and 1998. This history in business, along with the education that resulted from his graduating McGill University with an M.D. in 1979, helped Evoy create SiteSell Inc. This company designs and develops a hosted "web business-building system" called SBI! 3.0. Evoy's claim is to use his knowledge of the Internet marketing industry to help "small small businesses" succeed on the Internet. Evoy's evolution in the online marketing industry has led to the popularity of the online term "pre-selling" which was first used in his company's online newsletter geared to affiliates "5 Pillar Report" back in July 1999: "Remember when we talk about pre-selling? What you write will directly affect how many people click-through...So take your time and get it right." Years later, he would go on to elaborate on the topic while being interviewed on the radio. "Pre-selling is not about hard-selling your product, it's about becoming an expert in the eyes of your visitor by delivering this great information. And once you've accomplished that, the final step, obviously, is about monetizing. How do I monetize this targeted traffic that's coming in, that's believing in me, and turning that into income?"

He served as the 28th Governor of Ohio and as United States Secretary of the Interior. As Governor of Ohio, Cox sided with President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction plan and was against African American suffrage. Due to his support of Johnson's reconstruction policy, Cox was not reelected Governor, and for a year remained out of politics. Both Sherman and Grant advocated that Cox be Secretary of War but Johnson declined. When Ulysses S. Grant became President he nominated Cox Secretary of Interior and Cox immediately accepted. Secretary of Interior Cox implemented civil service reform into the Department of Interior. Grant initially supported Cox and civil service reform creating America's first Civil Service Commission. However, Cox was opposed by Republican Party managers. President Grant and Secretary Cox were at odds over the fraudulent McGarahan Claims and the Dominican Republic annexation treaty. Secretary Cox advocated a lasting, honest, and comprehensive Indian policy legislated by Congress after the Piegan Indian massacre. Cox resigned as Secretary of Interior having been unable to gain Grant's support over the fraudulent McGarrahan claims controversy. Although Cox was a reformer, Grant had believed Cox had overstepped his authority as Secretary of Interior and had undermined his authority as President. Cox for his part admired Grant and was upset at not retaining Grant's favor. In 1872 Cox joined the Liberal Republicans in opposition to Grant's renomination. In 1876 Cox returned to politics and was elected to and served one term as United States Congressman of Ohio. Congressman Cox supported President Hayes's reform efforts, but his term as Congressman was unsuccessful at establishing permanent Civil Service reform. Cox retired and did not return to active politics, using his time to write several books on Civil War campaigns.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Wertheimer	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montreal	Robert Wertheimer (b: Montreal, Quebec, Canada) is an award-winning writer, producer, director and executive producer of film and television productions. Wertheimer started working in 1977. Wertheimer graduated from the University of Vermont's Economics and Business Administration program and also studied Communication Arts at Concordia University in Montreal under the tutelage of Marc Gervais. Deeply influenced by Gervais, Wertheimer gave particular focus to French New Wave Cinema and the impact of Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut and others is still readily apparent in his work. After a long career making theatrical feature films (including Deepa Mehta's Sam & Me which was honoured at the Cannes Film Festival the year of its release, box office champion Bollywood/Hollywood, also written and directed by Deepa Mehta) and television series (Friday the 13th: The Series; War of the Worlds; RoboCop: The Series; and including his Gemini for Best Series for Due South), Wertheimer made the choice to write and create his own material. In 2004, his first television series as co-creator and showrunner, Charlie Jade, commenced production in Cape Town, South Africa. Ultimately, 21 episodes of the program would be made. Charlie Jade was inspired by The Culture of Make Believe by activist author, Derrick Jensen. It was designed to echo Jensen's themes of corporate greed and arrogance and the futility of continuing to pursue an impersonal, materialist agenda on a global scale. These themes are apparent in the design of the story across three parallel universes as well as in the perspective of the main characters who are depicted struggling with the personal and ethical dilemmas triggered by their actions in these universes. In addition to South Africa, Charlie Jade has been broadcast in Canada, Japan, Eastern Europe, France and the United Kingdom. In 2008, the Sci-Fi Channel acquired rights to broadcast the show in the United States. Wertheimer's next creative effort was the television series Across the River to Motor City which he co-created with Denis McGrath. Produced in partnership with Richard Mozer and David Devine of Devine Entertainment, Across the River to Motor City was an examination of two stages of one man's life threaded through a mystery involving the conspiracy speculation surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Wertheimer lives in Los Angeles, California.

Her father, Jean Bissonnette, was famous as a television director with Télévision de Radio-Canada. Anik Bissonnette began her training at the École de danse Eddy Toussaint, primarily under Camilla Malashenko. In 1979, she joined Toussaint's troupe, Le Ballet de Montréal Eddy Toussaint. Her extraordinary physical attributes – long arms, elegant hyperextended legs and high arches, combined with her feline agility and beautiful face – set her apart from the other dancers and garnered her leading roles right from the start. She created many leading roles in Toussaint's choreographies, including Rose La tulipe (1979), Un simple moment (1981), Requiem de Mozart (1986), New World Symphony (1987), and Bonjour Brel (1988). Under Mr. Toussaint's artistic direction, Bissonnette formed a memorable partnership with Louis Robitaille. She starred in many televised productions with Le Ballet de Montréal Eddy Toussaint and performed in Night Magic, a film directed by Lewis Furey. Her participation in the 1984 Helsinki Ballet Competition netted Toussaint first prize for his choreography in Un simple moment. She danced the role of Giselle for the first time in Odessa, Russia, in 1988. The following year, she was invited to Toulouse, where she danced the part of Odette/Odile in Swan Lake with Laurent Hilaire, principal dancer with the Opéra de Paris. In 1991, she resumed the role, partnered by Éric Vu An, another Paris Opera étoile. She also danced the role of Juliet in Nicholas Beriozoff's Romeo and Juliet, as well as Cinderella in the work of the same name. In 1989, Bissonnete joined Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in Montréal and was named principal dancer the following year, thus gaining access to roles that showcased the full range of her enormous talent. Leading roles in great classics like The Nutcracker, Coppélia, La Fille Mal Gardée, Les Sylphides, Giselle and Swan Lake allowed audiences to appreciate her versatility. She performed the dramatic principal roles in Antony Tudor's Jardin aux lilas and Pillar of Fire and in José Limon's Moor's Pavane. With her flawless technique, she has also performed in some 10 ballets by George Balanchine. Throughout her career with Les Grands, Bissonnette has been fortunate to work with some of the greatest choreographers today, including James Kudelka, William Forsythe, Jiri Kylian, Ohad Naharin, Nacho Duato, Nils Christe, Susan Toumine and Hans van Manen. Montréal choreographer Ginette Laurin and a number of up-and-coming choreographers (including Kevin O'Day, Gioconda Barbuto, Septim Webre, Didy Veldman and Stijn Celis) have also had the pleasure of working with her. In 2001, she created the role of Lisa in Kim Brandstrup's La Dame de pique. Bissonnette performs regularly in galas around the world: Melbourne, Athens, Prague, Budapest, Thessaloniki, Montréal, New York City, Toronto, Vienne, Spoleto (Italy), Helsinki, Bratislav and many more. In 2005, she was invited by Carla Fracci of Rome's teatro dell'Opera to revive the ballet La Chatte, which Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montréal had staged for her in 1990. She performed recently in Vienna for the closing of Tanz für Europa. In tandem with her stage career, Bissonnette is Artistic Director of the Festival des Arts de Saint-Sauveur and President of the Regroupement québécois de la danse. In 1995, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1996, she was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec. In 2014, Bissonnette received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award (GGPAA) for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada's highest honour in the performing arts.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Don_Getty	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montreal	Donald Ross "Don" Getty, OC AOE (August 30, 1933 – February 26, 2016) was a Canadian politician who served as the 11th Premier of Alberta between 1985 and 1992. A member of the Progressive Conservatives, he served as Energy Minister and Federal and Intergovernmental Affairs Minister in the government of Peter Lougheed before leaving politics for the private sector in 1979. He returned to politics six years later to contest the leadership contest resulting from Lougheed's retirement. He defeated two other candidates, and became Premier November 1, 1985. As Premier, Getty was faced with an economic slowdown and falling energy prices, which hit Alberta's petroleum-dominated economy hard. Faced with mounting government deficits and increasing unemployment, he cut social spending and intervened with government money to prevent businesses from failing. Several of these interventions backfired in high profile fashion, failing at their intended objective and costing scarce public funds as well. While some analysts argue that Getty's fiscal program laid the groundwork for Ralph Klein's later balancing of the provincial budget, on Getty's departure from office the government's debt had reached $11 billion, setting the stage for his successor to characterize the Getty years as an era of wasteful and excessive spending. His efforts at strengthening Alberta's presence in Canada initially appeared more successful, as he won the agreement of Canada's other first ministers in including elements of Senate reform in the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords, but these efforts came to naught when both accords were rejected—the second by the Canadian public, including a majority of Albertans. Getty was also facing political problems within Alberta, including a defeat in his home riding of Edmonton-Whitemud in the 1989 election (leading to a successful by-election in Stettler, vacated by a P.C. MLA) and leadership machinations from some of his own ministers. In light of this, he resigned the Premiership in 1992. Before entering politics, Getty had been a quarterback for the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League. He passed for more than eight thousand yards over his ten-year career, and was put on the team's Wall of Fame in 1992.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moe_Herscovitch	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montreal	Moe 'Montgomery' Hart Herscovitch (October 27, 1896 – July 21, 1969) was a Canadian middleweight and welterweight boxer who competed in the early 1920s. He was also a prominent rugby player in Montreal. Born in Romania to Vetra 'William' and Anna Herscovitch, he emigrated with his parents and siblings to Montréal, Canada. He Anglicized his given name to 'Montgomery,' but was known to everyone as 'Moe.' Although short in stature (his military enlistment form has him at five foot, six inches), he was incredibly athletic. He played football with the Montreal Football Club of the Inter-Provincial Rugby Union until 1915 when it was disbanded due to the increasing hostilities of World War I. Eager to do his part, Herscovitch joined the 66th Battery, Canadian Expeditionary Forces. A gunner, while posted overseas he took up the sport of boxing, winning a number of competitions, including the Aldershot welterweight division. When he returned from the War in 1919, he played with Montreal's successor rugby team (which won the division championships that year), but he also continued to box. He was selected for Canada's 1920 Olympic boxing team and assigned to its middleweight division. At Antwerp that August, he won a bronze medal, losing the silver to fellow Canadian Georges Prud'homme in the semi-final. Herscovitch turned pro early the next year, and defeated Olympic gold medalist Bert Schneider on May 18, 1921. He spent the next few years fighting in Canada and New York City, putting together an inconsistent record. He beat Prud'homme in 1922, but suffered losses, including his fight against world titleholder Mickey Walker on December 21, 1923 in Toronto, in which Herscovitch was billed as the Canadian welterweight champion. Walker won with a sixth round knockout, having broken his opponent's right hand during the fight. Herscovitch retired in the summer of 1924, and began volunteering as a boxing coach at the Montreal YMHA. Although he boxed at a time when fighters wore no protective gear, 'Moe' had never suffered a debilitating injury in the ring. However, on July 24, 1943 while on holiday at the summer resort of Plage Laval, he and some companions were set upon by an anti-Semitic mob and beaten so badly that surgeons were forced to remove one of his eyes. He continued to be actively involved in sports and his community, and served as president of the Quebec Rugby Union.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Trudeau	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montreal	Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau PC CC CH QC FRSC (/truːˈdoʊ/; French pronunciation: ​[tʁydo]; October 18, 1919 – September 28, 2000), usually known as Pierre Trudeau or Pierre Elliott Trudeau, was a Canadian politician who served as the 15th Prime Minister of Canada from April 20, 1968, to June 4, 1979, and again from March 3, 1980, to June 30, 1984. Trudeau gained fame as a lawyer, intellectual, and activist in Quebec politics. In the 1960s he entered federal politics by joining the Liberal Party of Canada. He was appointed as Lester B. Pearson's Parliamentary Secretary and later became his Minister of Justice. Trudeau became a media sensation, inspiring "Trudeaumania", and took charge of the Liberals in 1968. From the late 1960s until the mid-1980s, his personality dominated the political scene to an extent never before seen in Canadian political life. Despite his personal motto, "Reason before passion", his personality and political career aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada. Admirers praise the force of Trudeau's intellect and salute his political acumen in preserving national unity against the Quebec sovereignty movement, suppressing a terrorist crisis, fostering a pan-Canadian identity, and in achieving sweeping institutional reform, including the implementation of official bilingualism, patriation of the Constitution, and the establishment of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Critics accuse him of arrogance, of economic mismanagement, and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of Quebec's culture and the economy of the Prairies. He retired from politics in 1984, and John Turner succeeded him. His eldest son, Justin Trudeau, became the 23rd and current Prime Minister as a result of the 2015 federal election and is the first prime minister of Canada to be related to a former prime minister.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ian_Stevenson	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montreal	Ian Pretyman Stevenson (October 31, 1918 – February 8, 2007) was a Canadian-born U.S. psychiatrist. He worked for the University of Virginia School of Medicine for fifty years, as chair of the department of psychiatry from 1957 to 1967, Carlson Professor of Psychiatry from 1967 to 2001, and Research Professor of Psychiatry from 2002 until his death. As founder and director of the university's Division of Perceptual Studies, which investigates the paranormal, Stevenson became known internationally for his research into reincarnation, the idea that emotions, memories, and even physical injuries in the form of birth-marks, can be transferred from one life to another. He traveled extensively over a period of forty years, investigating three thousand cases of children around the world who claimed to remember past lives. His position was that certain phobias, philias, unusual abilities and illnesses could not be explained by heredity or the environment. He believed that soul transfer, commonly referred to as reincarnation, provided a third type of explanation. Stevenson helped to found the Society for Scientific Exploration in 1982, and was the author of around three hundred papers and fourteen books on reincarnation, including Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation (1966) and European Cases of the Reincarnation Type (2003). His major work was the 2,268-page, two-volume Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks and Birth Defects (1997). This reported two hundred cases of birth-marks that, he believed, corresponded with a wound on the deceased person whose life the child recalled. He wrote a shorter version of the same research for the general reader, Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect (1997). Reaction to his work was mixed. In his New York Times obituary, Margalit Fox wrote that Stevenson's supporters saw him as a misunderstood genius, but that most scientists had simply ignored his research, regarding him as earnest but gullible. His life and work became the subject of three supportive books, Old Souls (1999) by Tom Shroder, a Washington Post journalist, and Life Before Life (2005) by Jim B. Tucker, a psychiatrist and colleague at the University of Virginia, and Science, the Self, and Survival after Death (2012), by Emily Williams Kelly. Critics, particularly the philosophers C.T.K. Chari (1909–1993) and Paul Edwards (1923–2004), raised a number of issues, including that the children or parents interviewed by Stevenson had deceived him, that he had asked them leading questions, that he had often worked through translators who believed what the interviewees were saying, and that his conclusions were undermined by confirmation bias, where cases not supportive of his hypothesis were not presented as counting against it.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raufa_Hassan_al-Sharki	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ibb	Al-Sharki was born and raised in Ibb, a town in Northern Yemen. Al-Sharki's activism started early. When she was twelve, she and seven of her friends walked to the house of the Prime Minister of Yemen, Abdullah al-Kurshumi. Once there, they requested better books for their schools of the same quality as the ones given to boys' schools in Yemen. Al-Kurshmi was impressed with their initiative and allowed them to attend school with boys, marking the first time co-education was permitted in Yemen. Al-Sharki also began working in radio when she was twelve and this is when she changed her name from Amatalrauf to Raufa Hassan in order to disguise her identity. She did this because while she had the support of her mother in her paid work at the radio, her father would not have supported her. Later, when he found out, he relented and she kept her radio show. While in high school, she was also part of the Yemeni Women's Association (YWA), until it was shut down by religious conservatives in 1973. The YWA provided basic literacy, craft training and radio broadcast training. Al-Sharki graduated high school in 1975 and went on to Cairo University. She came back from school not wearing a niqab any longer. In 1979, Al-Sharki reopening the YWA in Sana'a. In 1984, al-Sharki began to work with the Information Ministry in Yemen. Later, she received her Ph.D from University of Paris in 1991. In 1993, she ran for Parliament in the country's first democratic elections, though she didn't win. Al-Sharki founded the Empirical Research and Women's Study Center (ERWS) at Sana'a University in 1996. In 1997, she was providing information about educating young women to various media outlets. In 2000, conservative Islamists who were critical of the center, forced the Yemen government to close the center and Al-Sharki left Yemen for the Netherlands. There had been a fatwa issued on her. She was also personally threatened and her telephone calls were monitored. Later, she returned to Yemen in 2004. She continued her work on the Cultural Development Planning Foundation (CDPF) which she started in the 1990s to support cultural projects in Yemen. One of her goals was to help "women learn how to vote independently" and she once had the support of the Islamist Party in Yemen, Islah. She helped register women voters in Yemen and helped train women to run for office. Her organizations helped register "thousands of women to vote." She also lobbied for freedom of the press and the need for women's rights. Al-Sharki was very vocal during elections, demanding a quota for women in parliament in Yemen and organizing demonstrations by women for women's civil rights. She believed that the status of women in Yemen could only be improved by creating a Yemeni women's movement. Another problem women faced, according to al-Sharki, was that many political decisions continued to be made by men in a patriarchal tribal system. One of her projects archived dress codes and information about what political leaders in Yemen wore throughout history. In addition to clothing, she also collected flags and stamps from 1948 through 2004 for her 2005 Exhibition of State Dress and Codes of Identity. She continued to discuss clothing, especially how women wore wore it through history during seminars. In 2006, she held the position of the Weissberg Chair and was a visiting professor at Beloit College. Al-Sharki died in a hospital in Cairo in 2011 from cancer. Al-Sharki's legacy continues to inspire women and men in Yemen. In Sana'a, her sister, Taysir al-Sharki, opened the Raufa Hassan Gallery in honor of her memory.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominique_Ducharme	CityOfBirth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montreal	Dominique Ducharme (15 May 1765 – 3 August 1853), from Lachine, Quebec, was a French Canadian fur trader, settler, militia officer, and public servant. He was named François Ducharme at birth, the son of Jean-Marie Ducharme. In 1793 Ducharme was the first white European to settle in the Fox Valley. He paid two barrels of rum to two Indians for land on both sides of the Fox River near the Kaukauna rapids, this gave him control of the portage around and of the lower Fox. The Ducharme deed was Wisconsin's first recorded deed. He built a house on the land and settled there. He began trading with the Menomini and Chippewa Indians. At the time, 1,500 Indians lived in the village of Kaukauna. The following year, he and another trader, Jacob Franks, obtained from the Menominee Indians “for value received,” a 999-year lease on a total of 1,200 acres (5 km2) on both sides of the Fox at La Baye; at the time Ducharme already possessed a concession on one side of the river beside one of the leased lots. He is presumed to have continued to engage in fur trading in the west for the next 15 years; certainly he acquired a working knowledge of several native dialects. Ducharme eventually returned to the Montreal district, settling at Lac des Deux Montagnes. On 26 June 1810, he married Agathe de Lorimier, a Métis daughter of Claude-Nicolas-Guillaume de Lorimier, resident Indian agent at Caughnawaga (Kahnawake). On 21 July 1812, after the US invaded Canada, Ducharme was commissioned a lieutenant in the Pointe-Claire Battalion of Militia. In May 1813 Ducharme was ordered to the Niagara frontier, Upper Canada, in command of a party of Six Nations Indians from Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes and Saint-Régis. He led 300 Caughnawaga Indians to reinforce the militia at Lacolle who were then transferred to Upper Canada in 1813 and based at Burlington Heights along with other native warriors. At the Battle of Beaver Dams, Ducharme organized a party of warriors who effectively forced the American detachment to surrender. Returning quickly to Lower Canada, Ducharme was placed under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles-Michel d’Irumberry de Salaberry; for his participation in the Battle of Châteauguay on 26 October he was later awarded a medal and clasp. On one occasion, according to the journalist Pantaléon Hudon, Ducharme’s Indians tracked down and captured six deserters from Salaberry’s unit; they were court-martialled and, on the lieutenant-colonel’s orders, shot. Ducharme, who regarded such punishment as too severe, never forgave Salaberry and told him that he would have helped the men to escape had he known the fate that awaited them. Ducharme remaining years were spent in the quiet obscurity of Lac des Deux Montagnes, where he continued as interpreter for the Indian Department. He died in 1853.
