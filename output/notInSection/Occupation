http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Mansbridge	Occupation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Broadcaster	Newscasting career Mansbridge worked as a ticket agent for Transair at Churchill Airport in Churchill, Manitoba. In 1968, Mansbridge was discovered by Gaston Charpentier, a station manager for the local Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) radio station CHFC, when he heard Mansbridge making a flight announcement. Charpentier hired the 19-year-old Mansbridge as the host of CHFC's late night music program. In 1971, Mansbridge moved to Winnipeg to continue as a reporter for the CBW radio station and in the next year, he joined CBWT-TV as a reporter. In 1975, Mansbridge became a reporter in Saskatchewan for the CBC's flagship evening news program The National. In 1976, he relocated to Ottawa to become parliamentary correspondent. Following a decade of political coverage, Mansbridge had become a substitute anchor for Knowlton Nash and in 1988, CBS offered him a job as a co-anchor for a morning show. To keep Mansbridge in Canada, Nash retired from his anchoring duties at the CBC. Mansbridge was also the announcer of CBC News' This Week In Parliament (1981–1993), which was hosted by colleague Don Newman; Mansbridge provided the voice-over for the opening, intro, and ending of the program. On May 1, 1988, Mansbridge debuted as the sole anchor of The National and later served as co-anchor for CBC Prime Time News from November 1992 to Fall 1995. During his tenure as anchor, he has covered Canadian news stories including federal elections, party leadership conventions, the Meech Lake Accord negotiations, the Charlottetown Accord and its referendum, the 1995 Quebec referendum, floods in Manitoba in 1997, ice storms in Ontario and Quebec in 1998, the six days in September 2000 that marked the death and state funeral of Pierre Trudeau, the 2003 blackout across much of Eastern North America and the death and state funeral of Jack Layton. His coverage of the blackout was notable because the normally clean-shaven Mansbridge had grown a beard during his summer hiatus (as he did every summer), and the news of the blackout broke with no time for him to shave. Thus, Canadian viewers saw a bearded Peter Mansbridge reporting on the events of that day. He has also anchored coverage of many world events, both in the studio and on the scene. In the studio, he anchored coverage of the Gulf War, the War in Kosovo, the September 11 attacks and the 2014 Parliament Hill shootings. He was on the air live when the 2003 invasion of Iraq began and anchored coverage of it. On the scene, he anchored coverage of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the funerals of Diana, Princess of Wales and Pope John Paul II, numerous royal, papal, and US presidential visits to Canada, numerous Olympic Games, and the inauguration of US President Barack Obama. He reported extensively from Normandy both 50 and then 60 years after D-Day and from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands for the fiftieth anniversary of V-E Day. He also reported from the Netherlands for the sixtieth anniversary of V-E Day. In 1999, he launched a new program, Mansbridge One on One, in which he interviews newsmakers. With the retirement of Lloyd Robertson of CTV National News on September 1, 2011, Mansbridge became the longest-serving active anchor among the big three networks in Canada, as Dawna Friesen had taken over as anchor at Global National only in 2010. Lisa LaFlamme taking over for Robertson also meant that Mansbridge is the only male anchor among the big three anchors in Canada (Mansbridge, LaFlamme, and Friesen). In recent years, Mansbridge has cut back his schedule mostly to Monday through Thursday. While he is billed as anchoring The National throughout the week, Sunday anchor Wendy Mesley has anchored most Fridays as well. Mansbridge is set to step down from anchoring The National on July 1, 2017.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Berndt	Occupation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthropologist	Legacy The collected essays in honour of the Berndts in 1990 showed the breadth of the influence of their teaching and writings, with essays by a wide spectrum of anthropologists of their time, including Claude Levi-Strauss and Raymond Firth. The Berndts were avid collectors, and their collection was bequeathed to the University of Western Australia and exists as the Berndt Museum of Anthropology.	
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sandra_Thompson	Occupation	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Administrator	Biography Thompson was reared on a farm near Monroe in northeast Louisiana. She graduated in 1964 from Neville High School in Monroe and received her Bachelor of Arts degree in government from Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond. She procured a Master of Business Administration from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Her career in state government began in the 1970s when she worked in the office of then Secretary of State Wade O. Martin, Jr. She was named director of the Atchafalaya Basin Division of the Department of Culture, Recreation, and Tourism. The lieutenant governor now heads Culture, Recreation, and Tourism. The Atchafalaya project, which encompassing a million acres (4,000 km²), is the largest bottomland swamp in North America. She left the project in 1979 to run unsuccessfully as a Democrat for secretary of state. The position became open when incumbent Paul J. Hardy, then of St. Martinville, who had succeeded Martin in 1976, ran unsuccessfully for governor. Thompson went into a general election with fellow Democrat, then State Senator James H. "Jim" Brown of Ferriday in Concordia Parish. She had a considerable lead in the nonpartisan blanket primary but fell unexpectedly short in the second round of balloting. In the primary, Thompson polled 504,808 votes (40.8 percent) to Brown's 391,849 ballots (31.7 percent). An African-American candidate, Ben Jeffers, received 253,764 votes (20.5 percent). Republican candidate Dick Bruce, a New Orleans advertising executive who stressed tourism and international trade, polled 85,870 votes (6.9 percent). In 1971, Bruce ran unsuccessfully in the race to succeed Lieutenant C. C. "Taddy" Aycock. Therefore, Jim Brown secured nearly all of the votes obtained by Jeffers, and most of Bruce's supporters are believed to have switched to Thompson. Brown won the general election with 665,608 votes (51.1 percent) to Thompson's 617,907 (48.9 percent). The percent for Brown and Jeffers from the primary was a combined 52.2 percent, or 1.1 percentage points more than what Brown finally received in the final phase of the race. Thompson and Bruce in the first round of balloting had a combined 47.7 percent, or 1.2 percentage points below what Thompson finally received. For years, Thompson said that she never expected to lose the race. In 1983, she attempted to unseat East Baton Rouge Parish Clerk of Court Mike Cannon. Though she ran well enough to make the general election, she again was defeated. After the secretary of state's race, Thompson owned and operated an oilfield trucking company in Baton Rouge. Republican Governor Murphy J. "Mike" Foster, Jr., called her back to state government in 1996 to work in his new administration. She was named director of the Atchafalaya Basin Program, when it was re-established in 1998 by state law as a 15-year plan to work with the United States Army Corps of Engineers and other entities for the federally sponsored Atchafalaya Basin Floodway System. Thompson has been active in many conservation endeavors. She is an officer of the Louisiana Sierra Club. She has twice secured the Professional Conservationist of the Year award from the Wildlife and Fisheries Department, most recently in 1999. She also won the Lyndon B. Johnson National Award for excellence in the field of the environment. In the Atchafalaya project, Thompson worked under Natural Resources Secretary Scott Angelle of Breaux Bridge. The media reported strains in their professional relationship, and it was suggested that Thompson wanted to succeed Angelle, then a Democrat and later a Republican, in the Bobby Jindal administration. In May 2010, Jindal announced the appointment of Angelle to serve on an interim basis as lieutenant governor until a special election was held in October 2010 to fill the remaining months of the term of Mitch Landrieu, who left upon his election as the mayor of New Orleans. Victory went to Secretary of State Jay Dardenne. Thompson describes her management style as one of macromanagement: "Most successful leaders don't micromanage. What we tried to do with the Atchafalaya Program is hire the very best architects, engineers, and designers and tell them, 'Give me your best. I’m not going to micromanage you.'" Thompson has two grown children.
